[Chorus: Aesop Rock]
In a (Getaway car, geta-getaway car)
In a (Getaway car, car-car-car-car)
In a (Getaway car, geta-getaway car)
In a (Getaway car, car-car-car-car-car)

Six in the morning and the walls close in
High noon calls and the walls own him
Kings at the ready know the walls won't win

[Verse 2: Aesop Rock]
Storms on the harbor like a harbinger of gore (Right)
Gore is my harbinger, pardon The Art of War (Right)
Get your doors darkened
By the house of card carpenters
Who never thought a slave could be a Spartacus and more
Pencil sharpener with a resume for the carnivores
Who take important conference calls in corner office walls
Still, a buck is a buck and he punch numbers
Five - punch
Just say no to company functions
And he duck into the dungeons
Nothing says "Kill it" like a day of fetching
Paper clips and staplers for the privileged
Two lives, one is chores for whores
One is where I wanna be when you begin regretting yours
And I poured in with a large coffee
Tardy every morning
To a man who took authority beyond what it was for
How you gonna pay the rent day-job-free?
Make rap records, matter of fact, thanks, peace

[Chorus: Aesop Rock]
In a (Getaway car, geta-getaway car)
In a (Getaway car, car-car-car-car)
In a (Getaway car, geta-getaway car)
In a (Getaway car, car-car-car-car-car)

Six in the morning and the walls close in
High noon calls and the walls own him
Kings at the ready know the walls won't win

[Chorus: Aesop Rock]
In a (Getaway car, geta-getaway car)
In a (Getaway car, car-car-car-car)
In a (Getaway car, geta-getaway car)
In a (Getaway car, car-car-car-car-car)

Six in the morning and the walls close in
High noon calls and the walls own him
Kings at the ready know the walls won't win
