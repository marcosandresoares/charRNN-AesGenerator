[Intro: Aesop Rock]
Limped up like a dog with three legs (shut-up) to the stage...
So many dark arts to choose
You can focus to the phobias involved in forty hues
Whether you levitate or bend spoons
Tune into the prudence of the
Dark Heart News

[Verse 2: Aesop Rock]
A system of gods
From each of the brawling tribes
So my bible is a pot of qualms, clipped and collaged
Pavlov's bad dogs parry mass bells
I don't speak the language but my last laughs held

[Verse 4: Aesop Rock]
Okay the rotary corner
Grow to be notably mobile
And social gopher teeth form holes
Or any scene where Brie is normal
We'll locate every exit, had seconds to flee the wormhole
When emergency diversions ring the celly or the door bell


[Hook]
Whether you levitate or bend spoons
Whether you levitate or bend spoons
Whether you levitate or bend spoons
Whether you levitate or bend spoons

[Verse 6: Aesop Rock]
'ey, four corners of the globe All invent fire on the very same day in the very same cold
Each sent a man with torch to the border line to boast
Watch them collide and explode

[Verse 8: Aesop Rock]
What plague?
Make an idolant brigade
So eager to walk planks
They will climb a tree and wait
Their irony is waning over piety and faith
So when the ghostly ruminations come
We'll kindly disobey it
I will live to be a thousand with the patience of a saint
To see the hoi polloi becoming restless in their tanks
Can't hold howls in corrals with a key
So will the worms please shriek on the count of three
(THREE!)

[Verse 10: Aesop Rock]
Sideways eye on a sinister boundary
Panel of contemporaries killing me loudly
99 models of fear on the wall timorous
Done running into to the car on the wrong cinder blocks

[Hook]
Whether you levitate or bend spoons
Whether you levitate or bend spoons
Whether you levitate or bend spoons
Whether you levitate or bend spoons

Three legged dogs that chew up the wrong food
Riff Raff (?) with (?) wolves
Land sharks know to take money, money, lose
Dark Heart News!
AHH!
