Is a love such as that which I exhibit for my practice
The factor which then amalgamates debates with straight-jackets and robes
Huddled in brackets that blacken the average globe
Xenophobe, loathe to modify the fly, feel this..

I carve a notch in my wall for every stall
Every fifth mark slants diagonal to symbolize your downfall
Drunky peasants, honor the shifty Megatron presence
Slug a bolt once ceremonies of merit turn bloodsport

Voted hella high seas, I freeze your mega dumb company
Pumping out wise beads like, plot sneak-attacks on dry leaves, dunce
Crooked rumors turn zoomers when rookies talkin'
Bad seeds blossom the Wookiee walk. Hawk and

Let a sucker drift, I lift up every stone prone to find
The point at which repellent signals ultimately bind
When a pack of style mimics see my brains target the cluster
I advance clutchin' the mic like bully to knuckle duster

And ascend. Your riddles yield a little plastic blend
Fuck a badge, light a bonfire dancin' jig around the pig
Figurin' yeah, I'll land a plane on bleached-stained trackers
Usin' only the finest and post-modern terrain mappers

Once my brethren disperse
My god, you think the heavens touched the earth then
Thirstin' a perch on a bursted curse
But I don't. Confide: wine and water chose me
Bored: lasso down Polaris, let the glow amuse me

Ok, I lay me down to sleep, creepin' a slumber under red skies
Heads splittin', straight sippin' a drip of dead vibes
It's red tides from here, stop and smell analog hell
Clenchin' a stench of burnin' logics and a child with yearning optics

Now someone's approached the rope, shaken like snow-globes
Other sought safety in numbers, other's flows got towed under (Yeah)
Still another took a turn and crashed and burned while others flee
But there will never be another starvin' marvel like me

See, there's a time when... rhyme and...
Paint combined can't even manage to tell what the swell is like
Picture your imagery embellished
With the hellish aspects of the swarms' forlorn facets

Soul crafted fact cats, boroughin', left perennial tenants discouraged in
Discussin' my four seasons flourishing, uh!
Searching, perching, poetic lead poison
Poised in ploys to leak a little bit of moisture on your pride

I'm a animated style machine intervening faulty production fueled by nicotine suction
From ducks in my carnival to vipers in my garden
You flash identify by the genus, species and class. Start to chuckle

Buckle the architecture til it fell through
Kill the survivors then raise the dead for shock value
By the time the pending settlement's fully negotiated (yeah I'll...)
I'll have put aside a few to get myself situated

So like sadly, my style spooks juveniles like Boo Radley
Radically weak assume the colonel Kurtz in our platoon soon enough
That's one bluff call, toughens the searcher
Stuttering, emerging, gutter urchin, bursting

I live for the moment of truth when Big Willie rapper
Acknowledges failure and states "Goddamn my shit is trash"
"It's time to let go." Tin man banging upon his chest to hear the echo
(Heartless, kid. Hollow compartments.)

Be we the people of the united, starving artistic
Militia keep movin' in order to form a more perfect union
I'm cluing into the poison panoramics brew the panic situations
It fucks a little with my brittle gift

I tell myself "Stay" (Stay)... up high
Make a mockery of sun and moon and star 'till they hand over the sky
My de luxe is, fluxes, pivots to where the crux is
Invade the town while village elders holler "Who the fuck's this?"

See: hipper cats aggravated, trudge through the muds
Quicken ones, plots thicken like, coagulated blood
Rugged serpentine climb, pebble to rock
Let your pretty pink cloud nine expectations please you not

I'm, Ae-*fucking*-sop Rock, mic bizarro
Proper application of the soul by my standard
Candid once position from which instigations spawn
And man, I plan to die with a mic in my hand, it's like...

Abandon all hope y'all, abandon all hope, it's like
Abandon all hope y'all, abandon all hope...

Is you fat cats or lab rats?
Trails to my steppin got em sweatin flashbacks
I played a part of minesweeper, plunking sneakers in my sunken city
Defunct, and apparently examinin' famine, I'm a
Volatile strobe while your blind spot swallows the globe
Sink through the track and think back
When I was a boy I employed styles exhausted
By every lost child at present
Normally I drill pillars of normalcy
You're cordially invited to accompany me
In rotation of the tables to label the opposition
As I choose, refusing to evolve with the cold
Rapidly dissolved my involvement in a solvent of soul and roll back
Brain trip the Beta weights trap for the slaughter
Like livestock infected with anthrax
On my call a pack or clan snaps, collapsed was the mandatory maze
Where the bluest ribbons yeilded glory days
Desire on the opposite circuit and glorious days
Is glorious hazes of gray spun through my array of operation
Slave to idiot box revalations
And wrapped tightly in a practice with my colleagues and slackers
20,000 league nappers and the swelling increases
Once the mortar hit the pestal your whole vessel fell to pieces
And I laughed, I laughed for me and my starving art family
I laughed tangibly, your failures ampin me to vamp fresh
My mic stabs white flags in drags, trembling
Devil skin-wearers through the terrors of compliance
Once the day turns night, senoritas suck the woody like termites
And wonder how they got labeled dick-hungry damsels in distress
The all new and improved poetically portable Aesop Rock
Available in stores with my, highly suggested parental discretion
In 99 brilliant new dimensions

Four rooms, a ceiling and a floor but there's more:
(close to insanity)
A desk with a subtle light, a window, and a door;
(close to insanity)
One bottle of the bluest inks your iris ever saw;
(close to insanity)
One child prodigy with a vision in his core
(close to insanity)


(yeah, yo)
I'm frost bitten, slippin' away in titanic burden nurses
Where the anti-hero clergy purge their value burning service
And warped was I, huddled beneath the influence of fresh
Meshed with impressions that appear to shrink before my very breath. (Breath)
These tides of woe and malice and mirth initiate a wave crash
Splashing my offspring graves prior to birth, it's looking bleak
Malarky farce sergeant crooked and sleek emerald eyes glow;
I'm shook in a freak side show!
OK, I strobe effects projective when I blink
So I design this chorus line
When linked we let our eyelids fall and pilots stall
With what I sing, I'll open lash light and dark clash to dim the wattage
Then see the wide-eyed dried raisin supplied fiery Colossus
Well, I am a hostage. Guiding, yet, pushed beneath the craze's climate
Hiding behind the levy while the stubborn rivers rise and feel this
I wish heavenly brevity centered hate pedigrees instead of dead serenity
God damn. Must have remembered me
It clinched me, it wrenched me, tempted me to employ it
Apprehended me, and rendered me suspended in its voyage
How these tables have turned!
Hand to the bottle with the skull and crossbones scribbled off the label
Sip the ladle. Drank the burn. Begging for dead!
Concerns off with a zephyr tread and leg in a web
Caught triple-six couriers; beckon, they fled
OK, OK, I get it...
Let 'em shake a little, then release 'em
Like, as if ghostly hysterics would leech on band aid completion
Odium, patience ran his anti-death commando
Just a litigant stretchin' to touch tranquil
But couldn't quite catch the angle
I'm trained as cornerstone famine trooper
So my tray within a heart of hearts still belly up and parched, come on...

(yeah, yeah, check it)

I'm a sideline observer alerted not yet retreating
(close to insanity)
The climate stubbornly hovered slightly above freezing
(close to insanity)
Now everybody in the populace awaited my reply:
(close to insanity)
I spit a billion tiny brilliant white lights into the sky
(close to insanity)

Undeniably amused by the way the fuse burn
By the way the clues churn in front of my eyes...
To fertilize germination of concern for me, for we
For he who's sucked into the trench, fully dug
I don't wanna pull the plug...
Hug on my canteen like in a dream
Centipede leader speedin' through a meaty greed league
I can tell by the way the needs bleed from a seed
If the breed should have ever been bred. 'Nuff said...

Whether compared to caterpillar and cocoon
To emerge, or a spark's soon to bloom to a surge
All I need is the nourishment, the courage and the burn
To ascend from a number, to brave Blade Runner
Hunter, cleric, swordsman, king...
More like I'm walking with a broken mood ring
Mood swingin' from the mezzanine level
Here to bevel the edge
My team's settled on the ledge to pledge
It's like that

In the summer it rains buckets of hunger pains
In the winter it's the same, with an added climate change
The remaining two quadrants balance the polar values equally for mid-range
Yet the songs of thirst remain the same
You could turn the whole cold reservoir to liquor
Hell, split the ocean on its seams if it boosts your esteem
I never lend span of attention lest my brethren signal fresh
So do your magic, miracle worker, or I'll remain unimpressed
For the flux, the fix, the famine
For the fact that little Billy up the block obtained a lovely hand cannon
I'd examined auto-pilot (right) when filibuster won... (yeah)
Concluded the few we're tuned with were now targets of his movement... (oh shit)
It's intriguing. Yet, I guess, I knew somewhere, something was leaking
Now I honor instinct, delinquent
Bring settler runaways, frayed boogie bastard clicks
To bypass glass stature, walking graft characters...
Militant dance split the sun and sip the filament...
Tracer. Vivisection is to lab rat primes;
They try to grace these sacred lips with his maze or a dirty wine
He knew. He brewed the substance just to mock the lesser budgets
Then sought off all trickery, bought off the public, and screamed victory!
Tunnel through the mite infested grillage and the rig
As fast as Aesop and his ten little fatigued fingers could dig
Trigger revenge, tip the goblet in the dirt, review my words
Spit in the puddle. Peace to fame, struggle the fuck out, and duck out

(yeah, check, huh, uh)

Now, all hail defenders of the trash talk
(close to insanity)
I was hidden, yet I slid in just to rip the mask off
(close to insanity)
I'm seventy-six inches of all the purest sounds
(close to insanity)
So y'all could dig me six feet deep my eyes would still be over ground!
(close to insanity)

(It's like that)


Alright, I can hear the ocean in a shell
But for the life of me I've never heard your surges more than raindrops in a well
Paladin tribe
Break beat elitists
Element five
Fully sold on operation, jeopardize of my survival
I will survive when sprayed by heavens liquid ammunition
I'll survive when betrayed by my brethren's wicked ambitions
I'll survive when braided with shuteye sticky thickets and thorns
Born clutching a fistful
The hurt's morbidly blissful
Forms spiraling
Sovereigns bring the rise in the funnel
A chorus line of blind crazes tap the water, find the tunnel
As skinny click, mechanics flock to block pick of the land
We stretch the Earth around the canvas
Drag a stick in the sand
And pan the hell out
Timid, you're tireless, bold
The cold that ire spits clicks subtly on supremacy therefore blemishe me
Oh, the treacherous penalty centers me, renders me bait
Skating slalom through this churning murder columns
I am not entirely trained to undo the shame
And all I got's three pennies and a rusty mic unto my name
Unto my game, defy the siamese approaches
Whose delinquent dichotomy comps Emerald City in wondrous novelty
Drink drum, sip a snare to spit a rigid sequence
That's when freak sons fade to black just like these pretty pink lungs, slugger
Paper dolls facade as swash buckler
Bounty hunt the front to document the frosh cluster
I am structure with a smoke ring, militant distinction
With a cloak-and-dagger stagger prime directive
And all else burrows itself amongst drunken perspective, fade me
I flee the scene grippin' the missing link like chain gang escapees

Build me, kill me
We cadets hold determination as property undeniably divine
We leak passion for the noise
There is not a track to cherish from he who lacks merit

And all I think about's the motion
Exerted to color mavericks alerted
Herd a billion nervous lost child prodigies home to flourish
Now taciturn facets burn open to yield malarkey
Navigator when wrestled on fancy driftwood out the vessel
And I settle
A conquest, stamp it, label it fresh
I in turn apply policies which require intrinsic merit
Try to wallow down these yellow bricks with yesterdays appendix on hold
Spot it like sky horizon, posed as barcodes
Load your fantasy
Interject a bad dream candidly
Blue in the face, through in the chase between myself and fame's embrace
Face engaging presence resonant with
Chiaroscuro atmospheric traps
Inhabit the land of denied clearance
Pigeonholed styles, drop similar
The course the corpse patients
Lacing non sequitur's that spittle off the chin
Upon the recognition pilot soften up the grin
Spinning me dizzy, cold
Bending my city to hold water
Yeah, we got affiliates, cadet merit and brilliance
Clinic apparel king-thing, crooked, I shrink, I sink into my book
It's like fury blew the scaffolding askew and tainted curiosities
Allow the freak show to continue
Forty thieves who seaved the cuehen commence blending a plan
And decorate the dusk like henna to hand
We unknowingly sketched the pentagram by sending clans of caffeinated couriers upon a quest to run the perfect circle around a star
Bizarre pattern with a bad vibe like Jafar to Aladdin
Pardon the carbon-based blaze amongst the stagnant trend frenzy
It offends me
Wait, ain't it the liquid soul therapy?
I sip to grip a stationary pillar
Yet we slipped these boogie nights
Sucked wattage from rookie lights
Now you proud
I'mma be there when you rush in
Just to touch the mushroom cloud
Drink failure
Lord have mercy on their dreams
Pretty pixels tend to trickle off the screen
Know what I mean?

Build me, kill me
We consider fresh sound play to sink frighteningly close to extinct
My life line is an assignment to feed the arts my spirit and bleed merit

The conclusion is subtle
Huddled amongst hermetic gutter-bugs
Peasants, and drunks
Junkies to critics
Sick dictators, haters
Kings to alley urchins
Monarchs, narcs to liars
Circling the wild fires
Live wires
I tend to blend an action less than orderly in
With an otherwise uncommonly primer to normalcy torn
These traits fade as cadavers due to conflicting data matter, first heard as remarkable's now labeled as unmarketable
Damn, thorn in my side
Now the high five hives despised from freeing demating alien seedlings, retreating
Burst the threshold, make the vessel capsize
Then the hollerings of buoyant survivors treading awoke dreaded leviathan
Deaded
Headed to crunch the world of MC etiquette
By dismantling mics prior to passing towards degenerates
How do you like that settlement? You feel that?
A maverick like myself bottles, will quit 'til the cocoon naturally peels back
This little light of mine shines at a hundred billion times the magnitude of every star
Within an ample sky sample
I alerted
My sole crusaders
To trade the games;
Prescribed them strict diets of DDT and Kelthane
It fester when ingested
Glorious vellum
Addressing helots to zealots
To Jezebel's to hellish felons
Granted my span of attention is not what it used to be
But most of y'all delinquents ain't amusing me no more, kid, merit

(What's up this is Aesop Rock for WKCR)

I traded my title as bent pedestrian for passenger status to coast muted
Finding the night train mildly therapeutic
Rugged hacker flashing mood full of swings
Beneath this puppet master pulling my strings
Leaking smoke rings singing [your despite what measured honestly magnificent]
Syndicate sold to children building homes for my omnipotent platoons
Nah I don't think the blueprints drafted tilted in the tombs
Tampering hampered scampered well beyond the dooms
We bloomed? the matter down to those most beautifully discrete
Applying yesterdays models stand obsolete amongst colossals [amongst colossals]
Comply not to enforce us aborted claiming they came off
Sort of stabbed them with the capital 'A' that sets my name off
Sick of it all
Sick of the stalls
Sick of the thick brick in the wall sob stories the falls the tragic hate calls
Shaking like magic eight balls pausing to watch the vapors crawl
My clique heeds lessons I'll be noted from kids sisters paper dolls
We lining up along against these great walls
Circling analytical
Rhetorical inquiries yet x is not applicable kid
(Your flash minor we as orphans repeated)?
You're talkin' concrete examples with glass bottoms cause defeated kid I'm heated
Its flight of the intruder and we all fall down
Conditions of never blends science with religion
Cut my character cleansed in esoteric opulence
But finding no intrinsic merit in your sense
Well isn't that bewildering
Drunken distortion and spit the filter in
Mic sweltering measures like melting my rings together an you never
Seen I Aesop Rock flop for the love of eighty-nine point nine
I'm here to ride upon the night train

[Yeah WKCR 89.9 . . . here for the night train . . . whats up to my man
Apex, kinetic, dj ely, baz, my man Dub-L on productions, the mighty ger, my
Man Patrick, Blockhead, Mr. Roper, Omega One, my man hates one, Percee P
Andre . . . stay up . .. its like that . . . it's big Aesop Rock signing off . .]

Check it, in a box marked "divinity", I trap the trinity
Of honor, evolution, and serenity
Pulled the reign into me
This archetype hyped oddities of style
Lost child prodigy intrigued
Fatigued by a suit and tie spy claiming post-Modern peacemakers
With the worlds ends calibrated in their briefcases
Case em when the sun bursts...
And the populace awaited my reply:
I spit a billion tiny, brilliant white lights into the sky (What)
When your last murmurs fade like colors in graff burners
Soon to be flustered and clustered in with comrade trash hurlers
Color me a sideline observer, alerted not yet retreating
And the climate stubbornly hovered slightly above freezing
Penny for your reasoning, Doug, which luckily I ain't as blessed to hold your attendance
So I could slide my guided tenants on the one
That drop in the bucket boogie begun
Brick in the wall installments draw a fallen performance
Fifth element, critical endurance
Kingpin allow only the murkiest swamp bot
To slip beneath the skin, this is Aesop
Recording til your TDK stops
Watch laboratory clone demotions dodge on natural hate crops

With the bearers of the reptile smile
Again and again, blendin' a friend with a fiend
Lending' a bended dream
Keen, cold, the straight soul drenched, temper
Fuckin, back boogie, I'm a settler
Kids wanna know the Aesop Rock...
The off the top, prototype, straight RoboCop
If you're Quasimoto, and you're slo-mo to stop
Ya rock bells, I block spells casted
If you wanna straight flaccid pass me towards... you
What? Kids wanna jet? 'Tis I, the 6 foot 4 space cadet
All up in you, kids wanna bend you back
So who's the next kid to rock upon the track?

Ayo, one heart plated with purely golden tiles
Mixed with a little mischief, behold style
Load a back alley shaman liquid tomb raider
With a most fertile assortment of spitting logic
For the lab rat's gone colossus in the spotlight
Now Aesop Rock be the handle
While your breath control is tough, to breath along is not enough
I correspond to a kick snare blind
But share the passion
But a small percentage of the masses and their fashion

Sadly I withered a non-believer
When pride covered this must lust, anger, gluttony, envy and sloth
Form the frame of your demeanor
I address but a rapidly lessening portion of majors
Dissolved in the abortion of creations new laborers
Pilot burner riddle of trades, divinity, composers
And tunnel through and out of spite the anti hero dosage
In a cradle I label the dreaded simulation we compile
Tenets embedded within synthetic inclination
We have never dined on bait so when corrupt crooks
Hook simple Samaritans' eyes buried in books
Shift on a badda datta sun moon merger to guard the difference
The New York MC population dancing uncontrollable expansion
I, cyclothymic pound dodger
Push a wooden nickel towards town squatter bother me not
My wallow across the village drunk and mumbling in the streets
'bout how an angel gets its wings with every blue note I release
An angel gets its wings with every blue note I release?
Could this be lies? Cause I'm gonna spit cobalt 'til every angel fly's
I blew the operation set to clinch victor
Walkie talkers turn awkward fixtures to complete the wicked mixture
The fire and ice combination adjourns fresh
I return with the last living specimen caressed
When the earth is vacated and the populace cleared
I'll be the last star fighter sipping a goblet of my tears

I forever wallow in glitches
Grimly distributed by side effects
Consumed, cocooned in antisocial trenches — drenched
Cradled between dense pillars of polar value
Lies a grey soul blueless
It's got I fiending for the sky
(Synthesized lies rise synthetic)
Sitting inside solidified plastics
Whose lateral burns germ-compatible
My firm's radically piloted
Dodging a fire swiftly
Yellow-brick stalker walking shifty

I'm but a prototype Metroid programmed to holocaust style
While you're sulking in the stages of denial
Your petty soldiers stand fragile like Giacometti sculptures
Embedded in eremetic cultures we's rocksteady vultures
Plus I's the geyser throwing a soul
My wingspan stands flags in the snow of the poles—
Berzerk!
Swerve my alignment towards solitary confinement and jaded
Stripping, color my passion mitigated
I'm slipping

For the love of my personal practice I reside
Where obstructive fluxes and societal withdrawal collides
Slide fueled by the fury
Spun a ring around my honor
But the opulence took shelter in my parlor
Melancholy masquerade
Cast amongst the braiding of belligerence and
Blazing terror that blew the lock down off my placement
I stay special agent 'til the sky falls
Reverse the curse 'til my fellow Lost Children disperse

I make music and connect color to canvas
Swoop down from the trees with potpourris of other bandits
Landed randomly upon the valleys of the grimace
Saw my planet lead starts burning from the outside in:
Meaning your clout lies thin
Salt prep the blades prior to fire phase in my ever-changing underworld
Serate a day to decorate a traitor
That sting never fades like belly wounds from sling blades
Follow my portion:
I'm gonna swallow distortion and spit the filter

"When I'm in a re-no-vative state of mind I'm innovative"

It’s like antisocial
Hazardous portion organically nourished
Courage to flourish in music's orphans
Lunge nicotine dream missing link weariest
Caution we proclaim till brain’s arch like Sagittarius Shield
Yield to the eyes as mescaline killin' fields
Rise groggy stone gaze marching moodily
'til ... plural styles amalgamated beautifully
Rudely awoke,sing rubber-glue conglomerates
Sucking up love
While brushing parasitic critics to my left side
I test glide
Kamikaze crash distort that's on my preface (check)
The therapeutic unit recommended
Now slow-mo Quasimotos teeter on ringleader status
While I spit satellite photos while teetering on the stratus
Sleepwalking the atlas after none.
Trudge and nudge my ninety-nine octane brain
To one-oh-one
Run to organize my mood
Like cauterize my wound and climb up
Lovely samaritans line up like bar codes
For a fraction of my factions
The hollow of his hand beholds contraptions via
Amplified files collapsed your cacophonic' conquest. My specs up
Morph hostile and docile insubordinance your phylum
Chordata asylum swarmes' your coordinates. Rush
Must not sleep, must warn others
I’ll tourniquet your turbulence
Then trample on your stutters
If I could displace every vagrant in America
With traces of my character
The Earth would be a more pitiful habitat
With infinite acres of auto-cry intricate nature
Swung open the nomenclature to obscure warlock trickery.Pure
Hazmat got tossed back by liquors supporting patience
Working knuckles for audio duplication
That’s like fiending for a purpose

Aesop Rock, prototype Robocop
Jabberwocky rocking on the highest hilltop
I possess two siamese styles that’s like connected at the mic hollering monstrous
Poly-tech impede indidgy progress, deaf
Swept off your meridian. It’s operation Start With a Slummy Raped Your Milk and Honey
Can I like, conjure up like all potent components of like
Middle siblings scribbling on his lonesome like
Hit him with my ninety-nine metal plated mics upon the wall, take em' down, pass em'round, rock em' all. Bust it
I’m forever building my City of Lost Children ripping rungs off your ladder at a
Sardonic smirk. Ebonics lurking where the crop circles got stamped out from the rain dance
Tsunami rain blast lift off like origami cranes and sloppy braincasted class-a-piece mastered to capture your flag then flutter
While slaves defy water sucked through from paper bags
The magic-maker dragging devils to add triple sixes melt the triple glitches on your console
I calibrate my mics prior to claimin' shit is rockable
Unlock and pull a backdoor for the bounce
While cannily panicking was the average. I broadcast modern boredom mesozoic poetry pupils
Caught up in scruples from the inimical nature of my program
Elegantly overcast password curse an a tactless bastard
Catatonic until personal practice mastered

I target the crux of all that's considered sin
The lost child venomous neck that spittles off my chin
Color me what?
Spell-bound man hunting hell-hound
Special investigations set king pin
Bounce and of course your happy
Mic activist
Axis pivotal point spun all to often
Now walk and spin cycle
Dug psychadelic syndrome jabs your abdomen
I'm adamant with disperse and curse across
You're playing your chances broken branches
Scattered around your mainframe type uproot it
My hand saluted eastward compass is spinning
Magnetic field my metal mind driven
Threshold fresh coke crush and affect
Mic check and spin a rec conglomerate
The all absorbing metamorphing monument
Not that average once upon a Glock, Glock, Glock
Dot, dot, dot, et cetera
The heated mass of fire and gas threatens your retina
Burning you back to immobile twitchin fetal position
Itching for what could have been if not for who

This is Aesop Rock
I'm with 50 million troops upon my side
Flying towards the fraudulence coordinates
One hand on my mic
While the other drove my flag into your sidewalk
My sprouts stalks pawns and then I'm gone

Close encounters of the first kind
Contact cursed minds skies red
Stuck sitting spinning world wide webs
Overwhelmed and worried, flurried on your sidesteps
My pride treads thick
Utilize wide lens I slide strength intelligently
We utilize mic like skeller
Tanky evidently all is not well
In a metra pot sell
Automatic hell habitat
Tainted polutin it's toxic to me
The melancholy-Olly-oxygen free on the night watch
Boo signs reduced y'all troops to tragedy
Radically millions morphing the orphans
Spitting distortion
Piteous portions lacked a guiding light
Overiding and striding through the night
Story army extends mics like dendrites
I blend life
Dark then gray shapes
Till displays made illustrate my views on sanity
If you're feeling famished we are family
Aesop Rock the canopy seek shelter
I have weaved a web across the sky hovering covering all
Night crawling audio visual veterans
Spreading like spores to the homes of all average Americans
50 million poets screaming all on the run
That's 50 million hearts beating as one

This is Aesop Rock
I'm with 50 million troops upon my side
Flying towards the fraudulence coordinates
One hand on my mic
While the other drove my flag into your sidewalk
My sprouts stalks pawns and then I'm gone

The sound of silence vers' the sound of War
Echo death shock-renegade
Crooked cynic tyrant
Your ignorant bias is my Goliath
Starving alliance seeps under the skin
The seven deadly sins
That’s the seven elements of the malevolent
The relevance of
Graphic endeavors
Drastic measures took for defense
My secrets unfold codes of conduct, raid
Blade runner, intimidating
Figment in the minds of the malignant
Your opinion: not significant, bludgeon
Poetic potential draws dotted lines between hunter and hunted
Liquefied thoughts seep through the cracks in side-walks
Lieutenant cynic consist of anonymous all this seems famished
Vanished in gritty streets til' city seeks, sleep, head, rush
Scope, infra-red touched
Temple's the torment
Pressure point contact
Crush the dormant with missing links
Syncopate movement, Our trobbled blockade ends but I’m blemished in the blueprint
Behold of the hideous
Some assaulted by the anthems of the lesser
Concerned, I squinted through tinted pains of pressure
Transcend, backlash, jet black ink bleeds to breath abstract interpose passages
Database entries slip through the fingers, you're forgotten
A faceless figure shall put among an infinite citizens capital coward branded in the backbones of the stranded
Ese's hunger for upper handed plan strategy: strike force
Pays quicken upon asphalt light source sun burst beams
A portrait of pillage
Multiple put-downs paint burn marks on perception
Indulge indefinite challenging chapters never before have human eyes looked upon
The unbearable weight
Contaminate little thieves
Heaves, breath, the last gasp
And I last grasp, but trace through your trickery, pinpointed
Technique cast on the fresh but it's now thickly anointed, vicious cycle
Ya’ll spinnin if you tread before you think
The center of my web is pen and ink
It’s the merciless, masquerade merging separate flows of music's martyrs
Threw my flag into the ground and claimed your land for starving artists
The masquerade merging separate flows of music's martyrs
Threw my flag into the ground and claimed your land for starving artists

All I see is little plastic soldiers with little plastic holsters
Spit on plastic cultures belittled by sarcastic vulture swarms
Warning I'd skip your stepping stones down by the sea shore
It's that scarlet welcome carpet that I fiend for
My dreams spore schemes each more malicious than the pre-ceding
Red skies bleeding acid this is best inspired by your doubt
All through flood fire and drowning all tied rapidy into humid winds
Lucid lens bend vigil spectrum's drippin' shades of rays, I prayed for days lacking discoloring
Bigots may seems to scare me I dissect voids my friend drawin' cranes with metal flanks
Walkers cross Battle-stars I travel far my radar flips
Eye of the storm following scraping my backbone
I try to spring clones leaving em like tendrils, that require
More than a click-click five
While figments of malignant spine pleasuring quick to pigment puddles
Gathered in gutters
Type B-negative whirlpool
I swarm fool like you, poetically puncture
As still in dreams while empires fall apart
He a cyborg killing machine with wires in his heart
I'll never know of you
Emotion reads close encounters I run
The last classic example of a love of mic and sample
Trampled pride resurrected with ample improvement motor movement mandatory
Not a question of should I
But I passively consumed the role casted by masters of supreme sources
Crafted by supreme forces
Seemingly dream catcher
Aesop Rock computer Hacker!
See you lack a dispatch to request back up
Collapsing scaffold mad pole crusher russian robot recruits
We shoot starving artists 'de trops' and intrude
I am waterfall
I'm excluding inaudible slaughter calls
Venomous survey calibrating mics for lurkin'

You replicas overlooking the guidelines of acoustics
Miserable attempts result in miserable conclusions
Paragon Pendragon tactician on free-form
That uncomfortable, silenced pride of combat cliques
That unexpected zephyr, the cyclone shifts
Worked up, you're shooken. Jutted to the side
I stagger this vagabond wandering minstrel forms your phobia
Worst fear. The terror-stricken muted
The roots of all evil I've rooted pinnacle
Poised with pride pouncing to break your stride, forsaken
Agony rides inside the heartache wretched condition
My intuition felt you slip up
You tripped alone what are you aiming for?
Or the useless tries to classify your genus, distorted fetus
Evolve, type unsolved, you lack the malediction
Malleable martyrs get molded, then folded under pressure
Dowsed with scenes of slaughter suspension
Bridge over troubled water drown, sound study intensive
My square drops to erase your lines like Tetris
Relentless agent hush horrendous circles on my pavement
Two sticks to burn basics that lie adjacent to my placement
On the game board, lunge forward and wind up impaled by the same sword
Choose your weapon, stains splattered upon your flag
Tattered rag shielding the exterior inferior
Stall face to face with a forms that force your downfall
Admittedly suspicious of your cadence, your network's on hiatus
Permanent, provoked and choked upon the potency
The peril be the penetrating agent pierce the insights
Why the cold sweats at midnight? Why the dim light?
Why are we staring at a truth from the inside?
Why the pen slide with vigor on a put down?
Like why'd I put my foot down stomp your city
A-E-S-O-P scoping through the myrth, opening minds behind the smirks

Only in my sweetest dreams do my streams lack troubled waters
Babbling brooks with babbling crooks
Only in my sweetest dreams do my streams lack troubled waters
Shallow pools full of shallow fools

I've seen misery, I've seen disgust dust ridden ruins
Ironclad oracle test recon unit disperse silently
Over confidence leads to irony
Plot twist foolhardy Icarus shifted in facets of my form
Forbidden aspects of the swarm a thorn upon your side
A storm upon the rise, Adam, ire crush come brush upon the red zone
Crook you're shook you started poorly
Your powers parted pace uncharted territory
Disoriented malicious bar you'll burn your bridges
This craft requires first drafts
Graphs, gritted blueprints of nemesis perimeter
Hunting by night compute, twenty one mic salute
One life polluted, concerned muffle moans
From the nine rings of Donnie's hell burn you in your slumber
Sleepwalk then pulled under now
Whipping through the willows is the warden of this garden
Slipping through the silhouetted skylines Aesop sidewinds jaded
Don't wind up war painted into the jungle the solution's not intrusion
The starving institution broke your mainframe
I pose the question, are these waiting games worth it or worthless?
While I comb the crowd for clues your naivety hands be my purpose
Our planet is the pivotal point
In which this network slowly turns to filter kicks
We out-box the berserk bewildered by the wilderness
My clench is frantic clutch manners falling through underbrush
Touch fools that duel with a dominant
The evil-minded tried to triple six me but he missed me
Intervene; emcees appear as red blips on my color radar screen

Only in my sweetest dreams do my streams lack troubled waters
Babbling brooks for babbling crooks
Only in my sweetest dreams do my streams lack troubled waters
Shallow pools full of shallow fools

APPLESEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEED!
Yeah, yeah, I recall the
First time I bumped heads with my head led to a dead bargain, a
"Thanks for nothin, lowlife" and a start of, "Beg my pardon,"
When a dust mite harbored spite it barely
Dents the cicada phase, blades averted
Decorate the backs of freedom fighters, servants pick those
Steeples higher, man the loose cannons
"Pannin for gold?" Nah panning for chance to land in camps branded with
"Push" stamped on their hand lets
Push, let's push up through the
Now, let's evoke a vow of
Zipped lips clipped to my peaking
Brow, I'm sleeping now, I seen immaculate hearts blemished
Under the mass of genie bottle hostages who wish that a
Third to her broken promises
Black spot of Gotham, fragile
Castle and master passageway
Even the innocent captives bleed
Bleed appleseed apple seed, leave me with a breeding
Hassle factor's feet
Pin the tail on the village idiot
Turn giddy click stern greet a burn it basics laid with the
Modes of neurotic nitpicking
Patrons and their pseudo potent
Patronage, ahh mood of the moment
Gloated in splendor of its
Greatness and I'm hella swamped
Truly moody in my days makeshift awakeness
Act as if apathy's been your best friend since the bonding
I'll one up you with love letters from despondency
Honestly appleseed..
Yeah!

On a sunny afternoon in lower east side New York...

You about ready? (Yeah)
Good morning my sweet vision of morbid disorder
And good evening wonderful riddance and such
Maybe today I'll touch the burgundy halo
Trimming the tunnels end off end with tenants spangled 'cross
A more tangible premise
This splendors, shimmy splinters all up in day-tripper visuals
Take it easy man, fuck it I'll take it any way I can
My palms are chinrests
When I witness fury scurry past my window
Model city in a bottle plugged hostile
Its bliss kissin pollution
And a billion suckers pucker in a bind
Maybe the sunken ship is the treasure
No, but they insist it man, I'm
I'm trying to spin me dizzy, sponging up to giving dungeons functions
As opposed to art historians absorbed inside assumptions
Everybody drop your knuckles when the style divorces vertical
Marveling at the spite with which it curdled
Outside my tenement: coax a little warmth
From out the mugs of masons wasted
Laying bricks for days to later find they own the lot adjacent
Mark the blasphemy, elements of elogance and savagery
Murder the gossip, fuck it, run off happily
The broken spoke cyclers choking open Doctor Zaius born fetus
In a matchbox keylessly padlocked to the hammer base
Now these impurities embedded in five illiterates textiles
Shedded in the hell tale to motivate behind suspended leverage
Now I'm drowning in a pool of why are you here
Sever ties with my beast of burden pertinent to if I die this year

My name is Dryspell
My name is pillar
My name's allegiance
My name is flagrant
My name's a thousand steps from patience
But I'm sick and tired of waiting
My name's Polaris
My name is canvas
My name is lowlife
My name's intention
My name is every imperfection that plays a part in my descension
My name is carnival
My name is posture
My name is polarized
My name is evidence
My name is delicate approach roped symmetrically to my fellowship
My name's Possessive
My name is cordial
My name is Igloo
My name is captivate
My name is contaminate the rich
And clock the profits for the captive's sake

"Let us hope that the whores of evil
No longer loiter on the doorsteps of your past"

Circle of sandbags dragged to shield the meal the needy hand grabs
I'm splitting hopes at your local Acropolis
Opulence in a cockpit not the pocket for them born with a pebble toss
Sunk to rest while they've exhausted the art of drunken address
Exhibit fracture lines that converge towards where the hackers whine
When trappers slack, the traps unlatch, the catch covers the tracking lines
That will make his majesty furious
Oh bury his head and how could I have been so dense
If only, yeah but I'm lonely
My days graze normalcy then morbidly crash
My years breathe honesty then sardonically laugh
Alas, I dig my toes in to the sand and spit foliage out my lips Personifying mankind's end all aspirations
Hope floats...
No, hope sinks like broken boats and most harassed before provoked
I'm tossing darts at a map of the arts to pick up where you choked
And when the last leaf falls off the branches of resonance
I'll be waiting with my butterfly net to collect the evidence
Well I am a room with poison oak scaling the sides
Arachnids on the celing, rugged thumb tacks, bones and rusty pipes
If you can squeeze between the bars (then please!)
Enjoy my space employ my waste
Encase the hand dealt by a stolen grace
Do you ever wish the circle was a square
So when landsharks start circling the borders
You could just cut them off at the corners?
There's a ghost in the basket of values
Pertinent to, which cayak pilot succeeded in surfin' it through
Now I'm surfin it through
So if you need me spread your wings to spell my name
Above the mess near the other funny requests
See my all too tolerant mannerisms have hired a whim
To assist in a meticulous pick a part of cobweb skins
Of innocence
A child of timid instinct with that ten step ahead premise
Supply dust bowls before the zephyr was requested
A mile in humble shoes, ten shades of blues come off the difference
I grimace, took me one hour's blink to conclude there simply isn't

My name is Dryspell
My name is pillar
My name's allegiance
My name is flagrant
My name's a thousand steps from patience
But I'm sick and tired of waitin
My name's Polaris
My name is canvas
My name is lowlife
My name's intention
My name is every imperfection that plays a part in my dissension
My name is carnival
My name is posture
My name is polarized
My name is evidence
My name is delicate approach from symmetrically to my fellowship
My name's Possessive
My name is cordial
My name is Igloo
My name is captivate
My name is contaminate the rich
And clock the profits for the captain's sake
My name is vagabond
My name is angel
My name is century
My name is hunter
My name is sunburst
My name is wildfire
My name is scrutinize
My name is basic
My name is consequence
My name is cigarettes
My name is cynical
My name is tolerance
My name is hallucinogen
My name is waterfall
My name is runaway
My name is alarm clock
My name is...

Killings reflect the destiny of the village
So when 20 count regrets float down futility spillage
See I'll pass the broken arrow this time for certain
Yea but from here on out its hoof the mare the bare footed urchin
Dig it in person
Now exhibit true audacity and passively hack reason to ribbons
And your excused from the round-table admissions committee
Activist legends turned hostage in fallen cities
Dirty earthlings circling vision immaculate
Spin me dizzy in a crosswalk
My too far gone mastodon senses inspect relentless
For fitted boogie systems and crook addictions
Well sure my crown is formed of thorns
Yea but my thorns are formed of sound
And I have found sound will keep me warm
When the mornings born with frozen ground
Put a rope down pull me from where the buzzards cleared
The meat from the bones you and your little bad-ass mad max musketeers
When the silhouettes of emaciated frames dance on a high-wire
Mistook for aspiring third world poster children
But is inserted ghost with dealin'
Dead to administer links like chieftain whats your forte
Knuckle dragger in disguise seeking the match made in your eyes
Friend it don't take the wise this minute triplicate pace unified
I don't condone the blasphemy naturally its procreation
From the floods, to the fires, to the droughts, to the cyclones
Tidal waves, the twisters, tornadoes, and hail stones
Whirlwinds, tropical storms, blizzards and monsoons
All of which I witnessed prior to waking up inside my room
Look at the crook as I panic episode tantrums
Fuck hugging my cool
The edginess readies the Mach 9 quick draw hence the duel
The company of similars couldn't excite the motor
But hermit crab Ace home alone-uh
One barrel of idioms and charcoal stick, courage under desire
Canopy draped beautiful messiah reluctant
Stuck in the pluck in the haul buzzing the fuzzing television mixer
Book of saturated matches and a half-made bed (sleep on my other half made bed)
Pick of the litter, litter of the pick
Pack leader will huff cannibal fumes, mechanical zoom
There's ample room
Stowaways inside the cargo bed
Said leech prior to firing up his barnacle magnet
Instincts leashing himself to where the wind splitting ice storms
And termite swarms are commonplace
I'm a trace this silver lining winding round the profit chase
I know there is good in you if one peels back the opulence
But I also know its ratio to bad don't feed my confidence
The nutrients will be intense circle
The clues units of success being personal
Then sucked basic diversion
Rusty anchor budging for nothing
Wedged between aesop rock and a scarred face of frustrated fuck yous Bound by concern
I can't believe I'm still concerned
I can't believe sly children turn in their sleep over one-liners
While I yield to hear your burns
Color me out of my skull draggin' a wagon of creature features
And all I ever wanted was to aggravate the sleepers
Look self-crafted heroics murder worthless
Crash test ideologies, catalog alien doctrines type disturbance
Got em out, killing machines turn belly up
Buckled, the troubles I've seen
Coax twenty four sevens of wide eyes from day dreamers
Clean or dirty serpents in turn wish preference for the latter
Justified the germs birth cauterize the gashes after
On my left, one finger for each borough I can touch
On my right, one finger for each time that I wake up midsummer night
Who's cloaked in a pristine mantle of hellfire
But A-capital glaciers out the east slide lateral
Born for one task indeed
To spoil the citizen kane emote self this ugly duckling seed
Look I ain't too attired of draggin the baggage over the seasaw seas
When the reapers turns mortals to caspers
See the plain and stone conjurable can't mimic the null
Of a billion troops holding matchsticks to empty cannons
Stand of a many moons when the sun hit the mountainside splendidly
Bask in the last warmth that be known to man's tangents
In the wink of an innocent starchild's eyelid drop he vanished
Managed to carve initials in the granite wall the damned it all up
I hung with cats that do the don'ts
Cats that forage through the moats
Hoping they open with sovereignty and a canteen deemed with prodigies
I love the wake, the watch, the walk, the work
The well its almost six o'clock
I've never seen so many tugboats miss the dock (watch)

Thou mayest indeed
Tune onto the forbidden channel
And see it like it is baby

Who shall be our champion?
What manner of channel beholdest thou
Shall it fall on me?
Deceit, deceit, deceit

"Getting dusty in the cellar"

Yo
I always think about my sick friend
Stringing a ring around my wit's end
Thirteen loops later his feet hung inches out the pig pen
Motley day goblins brought up pillage to pass the stillness
With bad javelin tip dipped inside barrel black magic brilliance
Who rose at the tomb of the Unknown Soldier?
To capture the fascist fragment choreographed in traffic dancing for nickels
Hooked like sickle cells to the principles of comradery
One hope distortion odyssey sputters itself to my how not example sample
Divvy the bread crust while considering the littering
I don't pity the head rush or the whimpering, spill
Anchor to rock bottom, rocks bottom packs a ravenous catalyst
Sprung alacritive, leashed by the carnal tirade
I choked when the cage bird sings it stings
Springs me up delirium to stitch the clipped wings
I sink instinctively brinked through while clinging the shrieking souls
Mourning the death of annal logs /analogs and quality control
Quality control, stand still string up the banner
From the beehive to the anthill; rag dummy
Incorporate the unison of Vikings Ship Rowers PLUS the perfection
Of the twice the Birds with half the Stone Throwers, speak your assessment
My communicative hindrance pleads the needs
Of a billion hungry victims gripped by the hell that's left to splinters
Shiving up the mass of natives and it's league marvels
One component's sure to shock a mass burial, breeze
Broken penny bank fragments float up at staggered seas
Dirty work plus applicants with chatter box disease
Iron bandit, give them the stars, the head balloons and rubies
Asked for many moons and I can't stand it any more

(Orson Welles)
Is that how I feel when I sling?
And the regulars were so amazed

*Record Scratch in*
I'm the mightiest slinger of them all!
There is a time for war and a time for peace
And a time to run and a time to split
*Record Scratch out*

"Getting dusty in the cellar"

I run a funny race, malnourished monarchs and loopy admirals
Where 99.9% swear by their broken axles
I built boats of a pack rat bats of bully club swung
Post utility inhalants nail it to stability and sail it
Lopsided starboard bow, crooked mass makeshift
Patching holes with chewing gum and sticking sail to dirty bases
Observe me sitting with my eyes tied to the clock, Cause
I know that once that wind kicks up you and your motors left rope to the dock
And it's the, art of clarity married to slender extension
Of blue sky over happy neighborhood
String on my ring has left me dancing like wooden dummies in a paper nature
Merry etiquette is a door nail, Friends is little brittle dolls of paper
In assembly, I tremble with a crocodile smile
Hiding a fish out of water complex provided upon entry
Now if I, were to fall to speeds
To levigate the game plan, would you honestly impede?
I mean I guess, I can just divorce me from the rest
And blame my chemical imbalance for the fact I've made a mess
But my loyalty supply hints on which inkling I should run with
And I'm thinking that damn town crier's about to fill this here bucket
It's that, grand precious that precious that part of you wants to touch
And part of you just wants to sit and be impressed with
Tainted agony induct in barnacle attachments
Mood swinging upon the barnstorm with perpendicular traffic
Spread, Circa 4000 circuitry burns cicada wings
Above alkadiene Townsman spoon-fed the shadow
I'm tired of being wired into the thief ratio
It's gnawing a hole through my scheme so I leave (know what I mean?)

It is the molotov cocktail hour
Haven't I brought you blessings without number?

They have plenty of nothing and nothing is plenty for them
Yea
I've never had it so good

"Getting dusty in the cellar" x3

And the saints come marching in
Serpentine regime ordered by response sort of fell this population
Caboose humming no fence me in a van with common patrons
The parody plastered every red brick in site
Where had to keep his plights from ticking
I'm slipping my key and whim dim by dirty tap water and that
Roach on my ceiling circling fins round a bed of pushpins
Let's connect the thrill of volume to a flat earth
Jaywalking a hook the past just passed the mere dragon bandwagon passages
I'm sorry, we've never met, my name is driftwood
Thanks friend, good looking, I'll never see you again
Feeding frenzy, catfish stomach, empty oceans
Spangled in hooks dangled by anglers off the plank of burning books
And if you're, not gonna eat that
Kill joy inherited by spirits lacking harnesses
Merchant, Goliath dipped in slipshod posture conceived evening
So I feed idea turn sun dial to bastards son adopt the reroute dreaming
Oh I'll ride the plain bow in flare gully yellow rain coat
Heard a harp but sunny ways my lifeline searching for the same note
Oh please, I know butterfly wings ain't fit to auction
Dig my tossing sturdy walking head hung
Skylark litigants strung out like cat's cradle participants
I am the trying diaries of a low-life siphon through that feign
Anti-diligence movement, here the hunger habitat
Working class trash raped where racist hit their high
I spy a toddler on the corner with her bubbles and her dipstick
I witness the fusion of her breath and her amusement
And it killed me and it stabbed me and it cut me clear open
The notion that this child timid in her sins embraced pleasure
Within a token of a moment, restless arrested but not a twerp
Strip the vulnerable disclosure, so close yet so much closer
I'll take the hint but still she's never known cold
Call me in twenty when those bubbles explode it's like that

If you'd have only held the cup while I poured

Back to back to back to stacking a brick match
With the fact that I've sipped the dripping sap tap
Casually out the limbs of captivated blends back
Tracking the patterns that trim friends to thinning savages
Take one down, pass it round among us
Liquor tip a drink, drink, drunk, drunk, and drunkest
But you quest tore your floorboards and the carpet turned marbles
Naw the carpet turned charcoals amidst skeletons of warlords
Snake charmer, hate farmer, gave you the rations
With an eyedropper of poison passions hoist above the masses
And interrupts homeostasis seeming flow scapes
Like asymmetric snow flake visits and with her symmetry blizzards
I'm sleepy, one wing more and I promise to pay homage
To those who stand truly deserving and the list ain't long
Sink or swim, gravel or ascension
Even birds of iron combines float if you let them
They'll be dodging more than cradles when the bough breaks
Note the eviction slip clipped to your little visions into cloud shapes
Oh my left hand is a brick layer my right hand is a plow face
We build and destroy in response to every sound the crowd makes
Sling blades sprayed it with apathy magic balance
On the palette of the almighty for painting the first half of me
Honor find it with monster mashing in text casually
On the palette of the almighty to paint the second fraction
I'm collapsed under the relic rainbow with seven separate
Succulent aqua marines hide the imbibed sweetest elixir
Star heckler elitists start gawking at yet another
Real conceived green fetus beating parallel sterile fixture
Urgent, the serge is like venom and over kill, kill, kill, kill
The over spilled theory's all faucet
For real, how many leaves your clover got? Mine's got eight
Three for normalcy one for luck four more so you'll spot it from space

I saw the wrought-iron cross inverted circlin' above my turret
Slid the spiraling banister down and hide, banished am I
My ruby glass glazed specs staple the trader of market thieves
Where vendors count the stolen citrus out their pyramids
Mirrored without a slapstick
Mavericks plugged directly to third rail surges
Piss on electric mayhem through city commuter circuits
Oooh child, raised as oddity, son of a circus side-show freak
Pertinent to the slide show, the wino's leak but I won't speak
Infected projection hung thick in the air
Pungent as burning plastics upon whiffing the nasal cringes
Pucker another 60-second lapse while 60 stars collapse the suckers
And I'm reborn every time the wine metamorphs back to water, my god
Sweet Christ, crucify me with railroad spikes
Use my skull to bash them all in, gather sit and grin, weave
All fail the most serene communication pageant
Where sitting with a stranger and living awards the badges
I spell merit with my name stitched on my heritage
And serenade arrogant simpletons to feed my cherished grin
Buried in leagues a "'Please', Thank You', 'Pardon', 'Excuse Me'
'Your Welcome', 'May I?' ohh, I'd like to nod but no you may not
Let's take a deep breath, naw let's take a breath
Naw let's take, naw let's aaah shit, well I guess that about says it
Maybe I'll craft the sycamore canoe and paddle upstream
Where the luck seems to reflect precious lovely interventions

I have died a thousand deaths, and I apologize for you and yours
For kicking your fantasies overboard
I mean I'm only one servant, making one hell of a diversion
And if the masses have agreed to split the sea then let it bleed

I have died a thousand deaths, and I apologize for them and theirs
For breaking down their ropes, ladders and stairs
I mean I´m only one servant, making one hell of a diversion
And if the masses have agreed to split the sea then let it bleed

You ever died a thousand deaths?, I have
And in the morrow stood a thousand steps from where my nourish laughed
And made a boat at, nomad, I roam in a social coma
Jonesing for home alone days to sit and count my poems, I
Dig in the dirt I rig up the earth like pulley systems
Thereby painting the perfect metaphor for hung juries
Strung along a song of spawning thorns of fury
Numb the anti-add-alarm before he recognized this worries me
Carpet-bombers spearheading fink operetta
Walk my line, now what? Now strut that little poison combine
Y'all call natural, in honesty promise me twenty thousand Sloppy leagues
And dive and finding my thriving ivy leaves climbing up the pit fall
Lack of most lords aboard, heroes unsung heroes unbrung rewards
Yo if I flutter in a trouble clutch then I dance fancy forward
Like park children double dutching ropes in burning city summers
My wing span can and will employ full expansion
Unfolding while lamping at home with my hands panning for gold
Told them the roof was on fire, when that structure burned to ashes
All y'all saw was Aesop Rock holding an empty book of matches
Maybe I'll sit until the spilling motors clear
Maybe I'll sit and stroke my billie goat beard
And rethink the time angels appear, maybe I won't
Bundled in my humble little plummet
Numb enough to die those thousand deaths under the sun it makes me sick

Yo, I surf an axiom kicked in a center fold by ugly tenements
Oh distribute sour inhalants regulate lobby developments
Today summon the rug rat oblivious to what's delicate
Tomorrow siphon imperfection out the fetus prior to selling it
There is a brain in the thicket tap circle
Cupping the port to accord it
Teeter thorn storm plunges more
But conformers the pouring's half the entry
Plated pearly gates a chanted axis
With high gentry hinging our binging on public picket fencing Squirming in terms in conditions of un-satisfact destiny magnet
Where the Ebenezer to Cratchit ratio tragic
Lose sight pseudo mavericks clash at futility pageants
I post froze in a blaze at a grand combustion
A leader's deception connection
Wiper with a barn responds his friend
With an eye socket full of needles
And a will to die for nothing
And that's glory
Abide thy crass itinerary barely suitable for common slum cats
And the lemmings will follow you to the blood bath
All aboard that awful train through shames patch
Where I'd trade my window seat
For one pane of replacement stain glass
See I bow to the the gods of opacity
I don't mind y'all looking in
It's just watching Sin City steam slips under my skin
And I'm about half way to nausea
Half way to contentment
2 halves post made a dance evoked a whole lot of resentment
Build a pen around Mastodon
Patriarch close to four peters
Woke to rope cubicles combines with combines suitably ingenious
Let's soak my feet in lake infinity
The time vibe strapped to dignity my
Symmetries vivid image still can't mimic the victory
Comfort is a drug and I'm numb as fuck
Yet some prefer the hum and
Others tend to suck the life out of the crux like
[One, two, three, four]
And I'm a tug dummy, hug the hungry
Pull the lever, push the button
Drink the garbage split the homage reap the harvest
Target everyone
Mechanized idols inhabit malleable colonies
'Till the fire ant dropped the sweet leaf, grief
Your dreams a needle in a needle stack
Claiming safety pin physics
Baby tin blizzards collide
While ole iron sides, trust the rivets
I'm sick of the picker the litter soaking the spot lit
When I know they know they owe all thanks
To the end all Aesop Rock shit, watch this
Oh, build me a home
Build me a home of brick and wood and everything good
With a front porch where I can jar fire flies by night
And smoke stog's till the day meets twilight
Build me a home
Build me a home with a green grass hill with running water
In a backyard with a sandbox and a garden of foreign flowers
Build me a home
With a basement and an attic
Where I can store remnants of the day I once slept in
Build me a home
No skull is sacred in the races
Locked in a pagan doctrine
Watching born again faces gamble up patience fail blatant
Ochre and sienna war paintings stain plague community
Harking as wrapped, it's overlooking out crops
Give you one life to laugh at catalog bliss
On the least common attachment
Ten seconds of glittering silence
Pilot is flight redefine stagnant
Most emotions host an entire lesson
Congressional, less one
Stone merely for the exceptional spectacle now
Listen the pause heed tall falls the voidance of the suit dispersed
Await a straightened arrows a perfect circle has been fastened
To the blimp side buy in my grin and clusters
That's better than colony
My own father's son is the holy ghost, suck that theology
High king for a day or peasant for a pleasant life
Blood on the easel and my eagle eyelid spots runaway pirates
Look, I despise squatters with a, oh, cry me a river
A quarter how'd you afford that dog and sour dialogue
I put my hook in the pond
I put my worm in the hook
I put my trust in the worm
That he'd bring me something to cook
I felt a tug on my line and I lugged a trash can
On my pole with a note from the worm attached that
Read, "Thanks for nothing asshole!"
Simple parables of nature making character giddy
And riddle me a similar situation mix city
Quick, put your honor on the line
Doors to the monks blood thirsty barracuda serpents and
Report on powers of devil treatment church links
I'm a fence sitter
Lips torn by both polars and their working
I can only model throttle at the dream catching
Matching a patchy holist with a sovereignty
Harbored and charged my hate breed in a minute he's picket
Spitting stitches to fix the britches in the gaps
One night I broke in
Bridges give us traps and
Tried to walk to get stogs just like hop scotch between polar caps
And I'm, blue in the face when every second is a waste of breath
Making that classic mockery of every step
Oh, build me a home
Build me a home, please, with a light in the window
And a red front door and a picket fence
And a fire place and a sturdy frame
And we can sit and I'll tell you my name, build me home...

(Well or, and this is, New York City)
Where the shiftiest sources leak out the back door
For more and this is New York City
(Oh, I see these hear walk
I, simply a shade of shepherd
Seems we share fate, honestly)
Oh, now wait a minute
I notice there making mockeries of mad men
Tend not to bend in the honesty
My twenty thousand leagues ending grants sardonic fatigue
(The view from this here segue crowds a listeners nothing special simply
Listeners, how we dissolve its spores and I'll tell you not flying)
And I live beneath the scenic yeah, where the fossils pledged allegiance
Where the centipedes and serpents bigot on territorial disagreements
The uprooted turned moody and hacked pleasure to skinny ribbons and I'll
Suckle my skull caught beneath assumptions pumping pistons
(Left the joke to wick, it
He walks whose out now, we, Aesop walls up)
We tune out the pouts of hiding
Twilight street merchants, we, deity freely and been here before...

Murder, of holy, in cushion
Partisan, part of the ceiling seems to be leaking, oh, oh, it's the wall
Forbid box been broken, from man of everywhere, that's what I sleep, I love you
It's not easy tying knots, whose paycheck may get rained
Outstanding I shall smudge, invest, it's dull here, since we need I go beyond
Grey, lonely, this forest is very very different
Friend hail things like magnets all the way meant was (It only takes one slacker)
Traveling up, it only takes one slacker

It only takes one slacker, to attack alacrity and compliance with time
With regulations poachers poaching just to jump the batteries
I'm juiced, noosed by the notice, seduced by the ambiance, the motives, and the modus operandi’s
I'm supportive, sort of here to modify those monsters
Tried to side wind pleasure captains round my hip line
My sit times on some here I lay my bricks alone to build these walls among
Us dreams can spread our spores but can I run with the alumnus fungus
After date rape, and it germs, and I burn for less fortunate starlight
Chasers forced to use there last match to ward off the glaciers
Pack a day profess cloud spitter, literate pacifist missed the pissed drunk of concert
Dull and system missed the funk I'm in a lull

I'm thinking of a number from one to red, is a beautiful color
To shade paper hat ink, I'm thinking of a beautiful color...
Paper hat

I'm thinking of a number
From one to home, one ridiculous tenement with no wings to spread
I'm home again inside my box of cardboard daze, I'm thinking of home
And I'm home again...

(Funny how, faces show up, waters for me, my mouth and snore)
It could've been me but it wasn't
The crash and burn and burn and crash infected could collect fee indirectly but it doesn't
(These are broken cards given
To dues missed of friendly lips tied life is going blank, slap look
It's mirrored universe and one god per so many square feet, and
Everything counts, higher life forms are dirty, dirty Aesop, every penny
Saved, is this the city of dreams?)
And I'm down to Earth
(I'm down to earth, road)
My zero hour snuffed doc, where the marked the day the mirth burns
The time allotted, knotted loops around the plotted, boycotted the wattages
Toys for the prodding of the rotting bottled hostage
One time down cloud me as the useless playtime string and think it smirked
Worthy well, your with me, from the icicle sweat to the self pity
Sickly thread bare slid back my needle point life willow
Man I purposely spun straw to gold to lace each last stitch perfectly
It must have been the dust, the dust, my god, the dust he clutched the
Dust, father to rust encrust the luck with which I touch togetherness...
(Toy, bird, in my teeth, empathy, dwell, in merciful spring, friend)

This fallen angel could stitch a wing with a shoestring;
The prime directive selects reflective aviation bathed in mood swing
I'm broke. I know a walking corpse who'd spit icicle dagger to slit throat
Quicker than you can prove there's four letters in hope(H-O-P-E)
I paint a portrait from my cell called life inside the tortoise shell
Tortured
Orbiting hell's orchard intrigued but not compelled
I smell a hint of charred child flesh sweeping through my quarters
Order one canteen of liquid caffeine and eclipse the slaughter
Now is you is the villain of my kabuki hologram
Cuz I hobble with hollow hands
Please pan the nozzle
We see intent to re-invent dream application with homage to ancients
But honor modern replacements circling now basics
I'm Bilbo Baggins with stilts tipping the Petri dish (fresh)
Beached fish on the shores where the feast of wits eat the corpse
Divvy the servings and study the traits that deemed killer breed credible
That's a harp of a different color but the song remains identical
I am not a crook
I cook the wick at both ends
Just to blend that element of chance with my tight rope dance
Life
Sight beyond
Fire ant with a hunger pain gut be gone
Belong to something civil, saint, cuz this Rembrandt paints on
And it's a cold canvas lodged in the gut of Atlantis
Some present impressive lung, some truly learn what a death chant is
I alone personify mankind's collective sulk
As a result of one angry Zeus fist blistering cult pulp in bulk
Face it
Die
Place it on the shelf next to the portrait mommy gave you of the day it rained
But y'all posed by the slave ship anyway
Make it rain 'til the levy breaks
My fetus breeds as a combine of father time and his sweetest concubine, wine
And it saddens me like televised casualties
I'll be hung in the village square in exactly 5 minutes;
You don't want to miss it
As a token of my discontent regarding the equation
I'm officially closed for consultation

I float; while everyone around me's busy drowning...

The harvest appeared less plentiful than last season
I imagine sloppy seed handling evoked a stroke of tardy planting
And the crops we'd have harnessed mid-November
Had only brushed the blossom bracket
Then soon sacrificed lives to icicle jackets when the frost hit
I sunk to find the warmth beneath the mosses
With a plan to tunnel past after the rains have run their courses
But alas, the portraits of these frostbit corpses tortured in the grass
Offered this torch supporter one tall glass of nauseous
And I'm asking you: Why's the spy supply hiding in strangers
When they know atop the food chains I could spot biters for acres?
Now be gracious, these minstrels turn a bully cycle civil
By dissolving the candy coated image down to the pixels
The upbringing of self-styled freedom brigade investors
And their studies connecting one hit wonders with dust collectors
Puts it down
It's down beneath your sappy sing-a-longs
Let's take it further down, we'll let Dante decide which ring I'm on
Nova
The elders took positions and the fans marched
Parched, plain and steamed
Hawking the rain in my canteen
Now I'm like point:
I guess I could spare a splash for a couple of heads
Counterpoint:
During my famine I never got broke your bread
Well, equation of intrigue, yes, yes
Lemme fence sit for a bit
These tense lips need soaking before I hand out tokens
Shut the fuck up
Drama like kabuki with a heart of dirt
Skull fucked cross bones hence my birth
It hurts

Must not sleep. Must warn others
Trust blocks creep where the dust storm hovers
I milk my habitat for almost everything I want
Sometimes I take it all and still can't fill this pitfall in my gut
Must not sleep. Must warn others
Trust blocks creep where the dust storm hovers
I'm tryin' to walk on top of sunshine
But it's ridiculous at times. That's why I'm touring with this warning

Crowning the glory of our advance
Fire ants to water beetles
These Freemasons adjacent to pacing pins and needles
Pupil turned pedagogue, benediction to my dream
Beaming a billion bottle rockets off the golden mezzanine
Check it
I'll pluck the petals off a classic blood rose one at a time
Gripping the stem in the right; invite the thorns to dig up in my lifeline
It's a metaphor for nighttime
Anti-up the slight cost of exhaustion
To salute the moon above paradise lost and you're a spectator, stringent
Inch by sacred inch shoveling coal into my earthworm soul
(You should know!)
Burrow up through the dirt with bloody digit
Lick my knuckles clean
Noting the corporate clusters holding hands
'round the abode of the damned
Now what's your poison?
Starlight in a maser with a nicotine chaser
Sip it clean, savor the taste to sit and dream later:
The eyelids pivot back upon the hinges
20 miles across the glassy eyed window of wonders to passers by
Now I'm 6 foot 4 with a 6-floor walk up just to recline
With no free time. The alarm storms at nine
My daytime's on some, 'Yes, sir. Ok, sir. Right away sir
Sir, do you mind if I breathe, sir?
Oh you do? Well excuse me, sir, fuck you.'
I breathe slow
I run in with these fantastic amalgams
Painting casket-bound careers to peers gunning with classic albums
Security's the javelin, catch it
Labor
Clocked in in '76 and haven't clocked out ever since

Feel it, it's like that

Well, so we meet again
(He said he's grown spiritually
Since the last time we'd spoken)

Ok, this is the dawning of the book of bitter aspects
Where the jackals sit and watch the pedagogues clash flesh
Poison function accompanied by six armor-clad
Black horse and buggy mechanisms
Tugged a portion of my severed vision (my severed vision)
The gathering of loose ends in a bucket
With a shoestring budget
Every man's got a field to plow (I know that now)
But it's like, man I really can't afford the oxen
Fee fie et cetera
I smell the warm blood of the bill collector knockin'
I get awkwardly sturdy with a frigid liquid backbone
I get swept in the pressure cooker tryin' to paddle back home
I get sprung with a vibrant alliance of clean intention
By eclipsing doom litigants hatched to bash these picket fences
Now I'll attend the wedding of the open sore and festering
And when the groom presents the ring
The bride commence the blistering
It's textbook magnificently crude
Prototype king berserker module
Inserted vertical thirst, burst horizontal (treasure)
Treasure, loose cannons span the starboard bow
Of the clipper ship dipped in truth famine pressure (pressure)
Cabin fever meter peggin' ludicrous
Beautiful cartoon troopers
Swallow brutal futility with a teaspoon full of sugar
I rock ready, aim, fire while y'all rock ready, fire, aim
Then blame the stationary target while the prey escapes the frame
Merit badge, marksman, or poacher?
It's all the same (right?)
So I lay across the wood perpendicular to the grain

I wanna be a big bang, gotta be
Never bottle me up in a probably, I wanna see a 'Yes sir', sir
YES SIR!
Thorn with a torn core, sore to the bone
Warn the other brothers I was born forlorn
Big bang, Shoveling a big dig
Huddle in a tunnel of big dreams I think big things
I'ma burn with this little light of mind
And a prime concern to earn thanks, I'ma be a big bang

I wanna be a big bang, gotta be
Never bottle me up in a probably, I wanna see a 'Yes sir', sir
YES SIR!
Thorn with a torn core, sore to the bone
Warn the other brothers I was born forlorn
Big bang, Shoveling a big dig
Huddle in a tunnel of big dreams I think big things
I'ma burn with this little light of mind
And a prime concern to earn thanks, I'ma be a big bang

I'm just a survivor of the woolly mammoth population
Bottle neck effect, sorta born def
Alien to shallow alchemy
If you gon' metamorph the base-metal to precious
Might as well steal from the rich, bewitch the peasants
I'm floating this homing pigeon out hell's kitchen window
Left an S.O.S. infested bottle nestled in his grip so
With a prayer circle release party and hearty wild bellow
I observed him fly ten feet
Then drop the bottles to the devils
Fertile circle turned fertile crescent via bad investment
Despised every second, but I guess I learned my lesson
If I made an angel in the snow for every rotting victim
There'd be wings to float this mothership up out the goblin system
Sticky panoramic contaminant planted
In conjunction with phantom assumption
Gutterbug alumnus candidates
Well, I promise you I'll man the lighthouse
Just to help guide in your ship
If you promise to help pull this hook out my lip (bitch)
Godspeed, straitjacketed ragged approach
To circle suns via folklore pollutants derived strictly
From a B.C. generation disgust
Community movement alluding to a
"No blood given, no recognition"
Life manner, I was us up all night with a rusty hammer
Trying to build a fence around these magic beans
My dreams have gathered
But to, that certain lack of avail
I sail a choppy lot with buoyancy like a bucket of rocks (a bucket of rocks)

I wanna be a big bang, gotta be
Never bottle me up in a probably, I wanna see a 'Yes sir', sir
YES SIR!
Thorn with a torn core, sore to the bone
Warn the other brothers I was born forlorn
Big bang, Shoveling a big dig
Huddle in a tunnel of big dreams I think big things
I'ma burn with this little light of mind
And a prime concern to earn thanks, I'ma be a big bang

I wanna be a big bang, gotta be
Never bottle me up in a probably, I wanna see a 'Yes sir', sir
YES SIR!
Thorn with a torn core, sore to the bone
Warn the other brothers I was born forlorn
Big bang, Shoveling a big dig
Huddle in a tunnel of big dreams I think big things
I'ma burn with this little light of mind
And a prime concern to earn thanks, I'ma be a big bang

Big bang, bi-big bang
It's gettin' bigger by the second
Check it

Ok, I'm here to rock the tugboat and bid the elders farewell
I shook the buddy system wisdom 'til the similars repel
I sell a barrel of spirit to dummy dimwit syndicate jackals
I'm broken arrow to the fuckin' bone (broken poem)
I don't really believe in God
But God, I'm scared to death of God
I swear to God, I never meant to spill the beans
Nor tear the pod
But it's like...
I hike an acre unimpressed and slept on the saber's edge
Enough times to splice anti-Christ's favorite pledge
I wanna know myself
Sorta solo sheep amidst wolves
And still my shepherd can't administer
The proper push and pulls
I push the ghouls to man overboard
Pull the bulls onto my sword
And buckle down in a corner chair with a round table floor
Got an angel on my left shoulder, a devil on the polar
Got a mug a frigid, got a mug a solar, sliiidde over
The recipe's designed to plug the appetite for continuity
By stitching togetherness theme congruents (beautifully)
I peel back hearts and lodge greed physics in the chambers
Cauterize the wound and heads like
"Gimme gimme something major"
Road side prophetic, ascend well (well)
Enveloped in a mummy ribbon system
Blistering in a wishing well
BIG BANG!

The ritual goes, same window, different visual

Wing of wax? Or wing of gold leaf? Choose one
Float or plummet 20,000 cold leagues
My nourishment's provided in the summer
So then I wonder how y'all chasing dreams when what's tangible still outruns you!
Hail dirty doll immaculate performance
Warm as the march of a billion torches forward to burn what I'm born in
Cut and paste alertness to current settings provided quick
Shimmy the pirate ship mass, spot the island, sound the siren
And about face
Let's salute the embraced pertinent generals
Who turned innocent hermits to burning spectacles
Flirtin' with a serpent working overtime, drain the battery
Siphon the poison to flood his majesty's hatchery
I was riding on a yellow bus to where the brush thickens
And it ain't exactly plush pickings
I'd rather take the time to burn every last bridge
I've ever crossed beneath the sun
Than live my life knowing you may one day follow me over one
Snake bite, breath too heavy to hold
Caught up in the wake of the red witch trying to swim it
Ran for the sake of dead cliques stripped of idyllic image
Steal a sloppy earth meal
Feed my pottery wheel to model colossal vision
Thrill, trucking with a bucket of pennies
I'm 'a drag my sneakers through the dirt like alligator bellies 'til the cloud burst
Honor and a loud thirst submersed in a trap
Little drummer boy vs. thunderclap

In a city of garbage, trying to reap the harvest
Adaption is the trap in which the artist meets the forest
Swing your little ax or be an oak tree if you can't
Either way; adapt to circumstance or play your final hand

You don't know enigma
An attempt to bury the hatchet rendered me victim of deviltry
Plus wounded like stigmatics
Something's huffing hazardous
I smell an inch of difference in this morning's pollution pistons
And how the loose ends drifted
My sour patch institution slipped in amidst the invaders and pardon my tone
But this garden's grown fucking acres since my visit
Itching to count the layers in the blizzard
'Til that chapter where my family inserts the dagger and twists it
It's a carnival
Have you any sweets for my weary kin? It's a carnival
Have you any feed for my cheery grin? It's a carnival
Welcome, play our games, you'll never win
'Cuz it's that carnival where every freak show spectacle's your friend
And I'm a ghostly galleon tossed upon cloudy seas
Anti-freeze to glacier, cookin' a look of fiery nature
It's the ceiling feeling too heavy to bliss the I-beams for a fraction more
Collapsed and left 'I'm sorry' tacked to you door
Pitching my back to hell's kitchen
Back burner murder machinery released regardless of the pardons
Hitching my life to the leash of one minstrel
Sick of same window different visual
Same agnostic hostage different ritual
Plague, cooperative super colony clash
I heard you got a dust collection, lemme see it
I duel as underdog vs. forced adaptation to the marvels of the now
Since then, my knuckles haven't once dragged on the ground

The ritual goes, same window different visual

I wanna lift every yellowbrick
I've never felt pressure to have to justify my selfishness
At least not to you and yours
Maybe just my friends and fellowships
As long as the mood is somehow linked to my enhanced development
I swear they'll understand!!!
There's a storm outside my tenement
Beats upon my windows with Mother Nature's adrenaline
I guess that's why my homie Blockhead stays glued to the television
Now I look less intelligent
Cuz I'm the one that tried to bear the elements and lost
Well it's warm by the filament
Huddled up close in the company of all my relatives
Stories, laughs, black coffee and honest-to-God sentiment
Cocooned inside the unified efforts to all get settled in
Away from where the rain pours!
Well count your delegates
Weed out the bums who practice migration other than elegant
Of course I realize the filtering procedure's delicate
But let devils inside to collide with your overzealousness
And fall to rock bottom
Spot 'em with their carelessness
The urge could burst to turn even those pacifist to militant
You can't even have half of free second
To become jealous in
You gotta aim, fire and aspire to be model veteran
Buried in merit badges
I'm stuck in the center and could care less
About the eye of the storm and its monstrous measurements
I got a defense that I call coolin' with my brethren
Sometimes I get wet
But it's better than risking life and limb to me, don't you agree?

If you wanna push
Then I'm ready to push
But if you pulling while I'm pushin'
Then why did you ask me to push?

Television, all hail grand pixelated god of
Fantasy, murder scape bent perspective
Fuck a sore channel changed digit
I sit with a nasty network intravenous plan
With a stable diet of my cable pirate
Yo, the doctor is in, the doctor is on
Born the bastard son of static radiance cloned to welcome in every home
Lead a blue screen, bruised dream canopy
Victim of the cursed nursed Technicolor drunk support team
Ooh, I love all advertisements
Though accused by robot news casters who capture and pollute
Spoon fed hazardous fog to joy luck catholic squad
Please take me, please calm me, please make me a zombie
Please I want to donate my brain to the monstrous Panasonic profit
Now, twenty first century plagued
Dispersed to wide eyed glamour addict patients
Telecast patrons
Blue be the propaganda banners, well, sure I'll be a Marine
With a clean sword and blue uniform, it only takes a dollar and a dream
And I abide great idiot box power supply, fuzz vapor
Black out of New York, hey honey, get the generator
I'm in a doom, doom generation, pacin', ancient electric secret
Never sleepin' to miss the AM oasis
My name is a wired heart, sloppy obligation
Turn my stilt into my guilt and have a chatter box blame frame adjacent station
Make reality scrambled and suck the life out of a hidden vandal
And loving every minute of the gimmick, change the channel

Plug it in, turn it on, prop me up against the couch
Lights out, I ain't ever gonna have to leave my house
Satellite dish, get up on my wish list, turn me to a tyrant
Let my clean spirit dissolve through the appliance

Plug it in, turn it on, be my mother when she's gone, great
Wipe the spittle off my chinny-chin during the breaks
If I gotta go blind I'mma do it for the love of all television kind
And that's fine, and that's fine...

Make me a star, I wanna touch gold
Hold me suspended in a dream, merely inches from the screen
Deleted passions sacrificed to one electron monster
Crucify my little future to the monitor
Damn it feels good, turn on, tune in
Zoom in to hug the bug up in your family function
But the children seem to love it
Yes mother, me and wild discovery
And heard the static flock to where I sleep
By the glow of that magic box big speaker
Stereo mastered often kill the freak seekers, eyes spiraling
Tangled in the star spangled wiring
I can turn from toxicated visuals
And all the kings horses abort the loyalty to royalty
Fuck the fortress
Riddle me with glee, hoist the end all teleprompter above my sleeping head
I'll be dead by morning anyway
Color my values with mundane humor in thirty minute tickets
To feel the magnetic seal picket censorship
I want commercials twenty four-seven
I wanna shop from my bed and set an
Example for all my overworked, underpaid brethren
I bond with a six string correspondence
And lurking circuitry circus
With allegiance pledged beyond the glass surface
Adamant students within the fine school of possessed graduate catalysts
Channel zero addict, immaculate
It goes- big screen, little screen, any screen'll do
Just let me hold the controller and I won't have to murder you

Plug it in, turn it on, let my little eyes glaze
Twenty screens lined up along the borders of the maze
I wanna see the five day forecast, fourteen days in advance
So I can get my two weeks notice every time the sun dance

Plug it in, turn it on, silent flicks better than nothing
Let a once divine soul feel the functions of the hypnotist
The viciousness, ridiculous, peaking a dummy's interest
Touch the power button meet your maker, ain't that something?

Plug it in, turn it on, say goodbye to Sunday afternoon
Fix the antenna, sit back and let disaster bloom
It's a beautiful sight, with a most ugly intention
But I taste it everyday and bathe inside the consequences

Plug it in, turn it on, never once have you talked back to me
Your majesty, I love you, I despise you
My everyday is sitcom, soaps, news, bad dramatization
Come along with me, my friend for the most glorious sensation

Shooken to Casper
Illustrate beautiful disaster
Flight of the mother ship lift to badger the male-factor
Marionette versus the threat of wire cutter function
Stereotypical Grinch bashing your pumpkin
Plug, try to count up your warrior hatchling batch before gestation segment ended
And head a platoon of embryonic remnants to the game board
Release Japanese beetle swarm to counter the spread of bitch crops
Demolish the harvest and herd colony out immediate
One massive attack, hunted, confronted and gutted
Most pungent component cloned in outrageous bunches
From the grimacing faces to the knots in my shoelaces
I'm a show you all the phases of a fuck up (Yeah)
Plucking the petals but every rose had its thorn
Consider that first warning, second will be good times, laughs and epitaphs
As a matter of basic principle next I set my boat a sail
I won't always be there for your tugging on my coat tails
Family stuck, voyage of the S.S. Martyr
Who you think put that unseen iceberg in the water?
Manufacture flotsam and jetsam from out your charter
We got the once pushovers pushing back a little harder now, blink
I think I can, I think I can
I got grips, muckraker major spin circles 'round sunken ships
Walk an invisible city of lost clans and he's jealous
Cause my silhouette had more dimensions than his game plans

Fascination, fascination
Fascination, fascination
And everything I do I'm fascinated with
That's why I pass the hated wasteland with a grin, cause in the end I got my passions
While you splash in a puddle of trying to pick apart the puzzle
Fascination, fascination
Fascination, fascination
And everything I do I'm fascinated with
That's why I pass the jaded grips of competitors who initiate disturbance with a smirk
Cause I feel I got direction in my work

And everything I touch magnificent
Picking apart a drunken township
Sitting in the rain rusting the nails my crown's bound with
If I had an anchor I would lay it in the dirt and mark today
"The Day The Earth Stood Still" while I complete my search
You honor delusions and falsified life comfort systems
As boy in the bubble huddled up to simple Simon subtle
Born tomahawk. Shock the peanut gallery loopy
Debate the cutesy, groupie, Kewpie doll community
And I'm hung in a virtual skin and bones emaciated ringworm
Circus freak bloodthirsty intern trainee urchin feast
With a delectable style compiled of that which stands
To buff a child's yellow brick vision of slick living
I observe the stories from my fire escape observatory
First I herd the glory, then desert the herbs that word it poorly, understood?
Well, maybe a pat on the back for the lucky losers
Who truly felt they were born to touch the music
I catalog cats as welcome mats, and for the ones
Insisting on dimming the stars I wipe my sneakers extra hard
I wish upon a penny toss that every servant will betray his gatekeeper
And leap to reap the freedom fighter mad galaxy
Huff the war gas vapors and cram hard for tomorrow
Brother, I own twice my weight in patience
Be it padded cubicle or beautiful tomb
I'll be listening 'til you whistling that more suitable tune

Fascination, fascination
Fascination, fascination
And everything I do I'm fascinated with
That's why I pass the hated wasteland with a grin, cause in the end I got my passions
While you splash in a puddle of trying to pick apart the puzzle
Fascination, fascination
Fascination, fascination
And everything I do I'm fascinated with
That's why I pass the jaded grips of competitors who initiate disturbance with a smirk
Cause I feel I got direction in my work

I'm twice born, once in 7-something
Once as the resurrection of honorable function
Been shoveling coal as the engine's doctor
Long enough to see my silhouette acquire a permanent kink in the posture
The maintenance of icicle spirit by the warmth of true endearment
Was, is, and forever will be a luxury
I'm a sovereignty columnist fathering doom document
Curséd version of a certain Virgin Mary womb occupant

(Oh my Lord, what have I gotten myself into?
Seems like I woke up in yesterday again
Another day, another dream…)

I know swamp rats who never suckled oxygen purification
Sure as blurry mayhem had ‘em spent (Zen freeze)
Stuck until my friend leaves, puppet for the plummet committee
Sputtering bum, numb enough to stomach the city
Who’s that hugging the silhouetted willows where the hill’s crest pan out?
Barter candy-coated crab apples and sugar-dipped death hand outs
I got a plan, I'll tourniquet my quest
Then feed a needle in the bad ending to mute the mess
When patience gallops with absentee ballots, I shove in the button
Strutting to exhibit mankind’s hostility function with a (heave)
Paling in comparison to Matthias, Goliath
Lies the rickety frame of the wicked silence
I died the day my nameless creator and I bumped eyelids
Swear to Christ we saw the same thing for a second (What’s that?)
The grand mosaic depicting historical glory of the legend
Nursed me through the time stick-and-stone mixers hexed my fertile crescent
Now all's well, I'm laughing on the inside I swear
Just trying to keep my head above red tide despair
My imperfections pair off with buddy system symmetrics morbidly
So every second of discontent’s logged accordingly
Now let’s turn mummy subtle perfection to preserve glory condition
And pray for the day a starchild tugs the ribbon
Better land a two-hand grip on that spoonful-of-sugar medical chaser
Credible crazer antidote's terrible, taste her
Barter with a Stolen Soul Peddler, pigeon backed feather pen
Never said a grin implied health
Consider me a mobile advertisement for that hybrid blend of fabrics I deemed practical
Now is you is or is you ain’t compatible?
I feel the wind in my opinions
Plus hyper clutched to crush one’s gingerbread tenement awful
It’s like the day the great oak met the sawmill
A lifeline of spectacular expansion meets the reaper at the hand of one man’s tantrums
My friend’s got a book about dreams. I look and laugh
I dreamed a book about my friends and still can’t decipher the half
Chatterbox. Now let a soothsayer major cater to a kinked breed
Battered on the brink of disease
(Well) I am (skin and bones), I am (sin and poems), I am (tin and chrome)
Grin and groans, fuck it, I’m tinted quinacridone
Blow the petals off a dandelion trying to make my little gypsy blush
And felt as if I’d actually accomplished something
Fortify the bullies, let a joke soak in the treatment
Sit and watch the percentages teeter on the evening
Caught a ghost up in the fuselage seconds before the cog dropped to the sticks
And stared him down until he fixed it

Oh, fashion? It’s cool and all, but what about God?
(Oh God? well he’s the man, but I mean, what about reading?)
What like novels? Man, that don’t hold my attention. How about television?
(Television hurts my brain. How about walking in the rain?)
Oh I hate walking. It’s boring. How about some old-fashioned gone fishin'?
(Yeah, fishing’s great, but I just hate hooking the bait. Let’s dance)
Nah, I got two left feet plus motion sickness. How about breakfast?
(Man I’m hungry, but that means I'mma have to borrow some money)
Let’s fly a kite. (Let’s burn the generals). Let’s sell lemonade. (Let’s drink)
Let’s poke a hole inside the tugboat, ease on back, and watch it sink
(Nah, let’s fail a pupil once a year at random to shake the academy)
Casually note the blossom of phantom alignment. (Strategy)

Well, I’ll make a waterfall out of water and autumn
Sorta caught ‘em when their guards mimicked the vintage knuckle drag sagged in the coffin
I affiliate my rag dummy appearance with a most cohesive spirit
Cried a river yesterday, ain’t shed a tear since
‘Gimmie gimmie’, crooned the Old Yeller community cartoon
The carousel ballooned extravagant. Aware
Inviting, yet I’m sworn to adamant manner and saddle in worn head, thorax, and abdomen
To primitive horseback galloping
My index finger’s dressed in my talisman
Branded up in the jackal skin, I spy mark of the product
Well, one must pardon ye old common sheep detour weaving graceful through the prime directive column
Pray the virus retreats to allotted phylum
Beanstalk with a fiend walk and my name is mud
But that’s got a ring to it, so my soil welcomes the flood
I walk as God’s practical joke on man, practically broke
And if they raise my rent again, I’ll spend my nights practically soaked
Who spit silk dimension through the noose looped by the rafters?
After lack of reasoning, dead ‘em. (It’s like "three, two, one, bedlam")
Ooh, I’m hung. I clung to hope, but see you in hell
I’ll be that clear blue icicle that simply refused to melt
Sturdy iron grillage, tin can skeleton
Skull of a thousand dilapidated dream remnants
Here to convict based on a tin bucket of evidence
That stairway to heaven’s merely a legend so the peasants dream well

(Blesséd peasants, blesséd peasant dream well
Every blesséd peasant’s just trying to dream well…)

On the train
Watchin' the rainbows (thank you window seat)
I mean, it's all the same to some
But that cityscape makes me numb
Walkin' the wire between firewater and water - I'll take the tap
Still managed to end up thirsty the day the nursery collapsed
In my hand I hold the plumage of a buzzard
Suffered for circlin' nutrition (seems barbaric)
I may have just saved your children
There's an inborn tendency tellin' me to grip that sickle
For The pirate tyrant breeds feed on your precious little pixels
I interviewed the sun, he said the future's lookin' bright
I interviewed the rain, he claimed the sun's truly an asshole
I was supposed to interview the snow today but of course he flaked
So I let my frigid demeanor teeter and take his vacant place
We 3 sprout from the same litter
Yet amazingly crafted by separate scissors
I sloth from off the beaten path splashed in the cretin blizzard
Half my time is herded toward little lost causes
Half my time is spent pluggin' these leaky faucets
An' I'm here to pose inquiries
I'm here to draw a fork in the road and call it the diary of common sheep aspiring
Little Billy starlet up the block got the right premise
But can't thread the needle without consultin apprentice present
I don't really know you (I don't)
And I dont' really care (I don't)
Can't judge a man's dignity by the wattage in his stare
Maybe that deems me that vagabond you love to kill
But I really ain't got time for the motherfuckin guilt

I'm gone and I best believe I'm leavin'
Pack up my belongings then it's off into the evening
Now I haven't exactly been embraced by the populace
Set sail upon the seven deadly seas of the anonymous
I'm gone and I best believe I'm leavin'
Pack up my belongings then it's off into the evening
An' I'm diggin' a tunnel to where the sun'l never shine
I've got my book I got my dream I've got myself an' I'll be fine
(My time) is the day before the day the earth stood still
(My time) is the day before the soldiers fired at will
(My time) is the day before the hunter made his kill
My time's the final mile before the valley meets the hill

And I'm an archer
Parked where the farmers barter appetites
Sweet-talkin' harrassment down to a mere flashing of badges
Prototypic landscape chased every step of my well-oiled collective
Workforce with frozen intention festive - wait
What about the captivated?
Well, I am the product of skeleton dancers poised crooked
Scattered amidst blue fields of fiery bliss mixed with
Disease applicant activist rattlers. Fascinate grave child
Oh you're expecting slave smiles after sticking the pin in limb
God, if I could offer maintenance to fantasies I would
I'd place the button in the city square for everyone to push
You see my mission responsibilties range across the board
Until I'd rather be a pen than a sword
I swim a cold lake, make no mistake, I was not ready
All edgy and outta shape, made the company look messy
(Sorry, well sorry) Honestly take it or leave it
Just let me know so I ain't beggin' forgiveness thoughout the evening
Basic locomotive with a whistle and caboose
Tryin to pull my cargo 'cross the map without a boost
Fragile in more ways than ten yet sturdy bird construction
Help the smokestacks puff until the morn, dream torn

I'm gone and I best believe I'm leavin'
Packed up my belongings then it's off into the evening
I've knocked upon every little door that comes about
I'll sweep ya porch if you can spare a couple of breadcrumbs and a couch
I'm gone and I best believe I'm leavin'
Pack up my belongings then it's off into the evening
This turning in my sleep is getting old and older still
I think I can, I think I can, I think I can
I think I will

I was sitting on my fire escape and I saw
Sturdy bridges, decorated with dirty pigeons
A vagabond begging for three pennies and a princess
A junkie tourniquet surgeon urging the needle in
A batty senior citizen flashing that awful teethless grin
I saw a corner store merchant rest on a milk crate with a stog'
A pierced nose, a model with a stalker, cheap hooker, jay walkers
A table on a sidewalk with four old men slappin' dominos down
A city, a village, a neighborhood, a ghost town
I saw vandals catching tags and Puerto Rican flags
I saw a pregnant woman on the verge of bursting
I saw a blind man with a dog screaming someday I'll see it all
And then he sat down with his hammer and saw
Business men with multi-colored ties, cashing their checks
A Nazi with tattoos on his neck, a Vietnam War vet
A Caucasian man with a limp and a cane, a pimp with his dames
A thug circus, a pack of shook tourists hugging their purses
I saw freaks with rainbow streaks in dayglo hair
A mother smackin' the grin off her child, replaced it with a stare
A pothole, a storefront with a broken open sign
A hole in the wall bar kicking drunks to the gutter, it's closing time
I see a fuck up, a bum knuckle up with a taxi driver
A squatter, a grandfather, an angry right-to-lifer
I can see the roof garden on the apartment across the street
And kick myself because somewhere along the way I lost my seeds
I see a rat, a roach, a bat approach, a happy student
A black man with a horn and a will to make you sit and listen to it
I see a little girl on the corner with bubbles, braids and barrettes
I see a teen mother with Similac, pacifier, and regrets
Oh, a day turned stale, a hammer with a rusty nail, a failed marriage
A universe of brick buildings slightly off balance
A challenge, I see a chance to add real colors to my favorite palette
Raise my mighty mallet towards the gods and swing my talents
I see a crack in the sidewalk
A slide show of sick civilians gripping bottles like idiots
Sitting inside bent meridians
There's a fun house ooh, a sun spout
Spraying yellow beams above yellow back dreams
And children in the hydrants
Hybrids, I see sirens
The wall to the glamor standard
A dead bird, a red curb
A bus stop where commuters wait to have their souls towed off to work
I see the slapdash habits of bike messengers pausing
To huff that good leaf on the way to damage packages for peddlers
Oh my lord, I see bandwagons, all aboard
A carnival amusement park where a heart is a luxury
I see a gas galaxy huddled behind those pearly doors
Maybe I should sit up on my fire escape a little more

My every little step set in a star
Retina scarred; tread in a sled of bedbugs got my dead head in a jar
Crazer camp stamp blank on the mug of settlers registered
Not protest nor approval regarding every morn futile
My experience with a spirit alignment interference
Assigns division from clearance to ample scrambling
Let's note the magnificence in the difference
Okay, see two canaries on the wire aspire
To separate lullabies both of which had me drifting
Every clan ghostly orphan scared stiff in the bliss
And list picking from the arrangement under burden
Bust, wallow in will to split the privilege cluster
Lackluster as if a journey choice grew on the nearest chuckle path-dispatch trouble
I've never seen the water so high in my poison life
Social conduct, twenty pace, about face, self destruct
I know the key locations, sharp enough to catch those subtle signs cause
Well, this here alley cat's been around the block a couple of times
Lifting every tin can, sifting every mess;
One man's trash, you know the rest, live it
Pitching a battered platform out of mass hysterics perished in the blizzard
When it's finished I plan to sit and observe the twister pivot
Sleep and sleep well; sleep with a sacred array of fevers
Wake as a pertinent version of a pipe dreamer
Y'all can find me if you lookin for a friend
I'll be the only iron-clad oracle in a city of tin
It's like that

I was born where crooked demeanor seemed to spawn merit
I was born where all the king's men couldn't mend a broken spirit
I was born where it don't matter if you stand, sit, or fall
To live and die as a brick brick brick in the wall
And I'm a brick brick brick brick brick in the wall
And I'm a brick brick brick brick brick in the wall
And I'm a brick in the wall, drop in the bucket, yes y'all

Spare a match for the most distorted orchid in the patch
Assorted orphans coursed in a morbid orbit forward the traps
I make a tentative promise to flash frequent
The most sacred abrasive based in allegiance to the makeshift mason's secrets
Water basin leaking, plug it up
The simple triple ring performance shoveled subtle imperfection
I rung a life's worth of saturated costume gear over hell's balcony
To nullify the drought and still the martyr farmers shout at me
And so the epic went and every cirrus hung
The bow breakers turned a cradle fatal, every spirit clung
Croon for the slick Icarus brain children busy splitting the givingtree
Building fresh canoes for freaks to cross the spill in
I'm frantic
My plan is dwindling with every pulse bump
Gods and monsters yield the lump sum of the dolt clump
Be wary when the stratosphere tints
I scout like Atticus Finch, inching up slow in the games of reconnaissance
Now cause to amend the Zen memorandum has surfaced in every Holocaust citadel fix it plan
Twelve easy steps to better picket line demeanor
Gumshoe
Stick stone conglomerate activate massive
But the sky is falling, fuck you
I've hired sweatshop labor to hold candles to the solar panels
Stitched in the back of my neck for nickels and sour milk by the week
Cheek to the heartache
At the center of my anthem lies a blend of temper tantrums substantial for me to lamp in

Every little step we take breaks the dreams
Of a war pig itching to re-stitch the seams

If we could absorb every star in the sky
We noticed some shine brighter than others, you wonder why
It's the simple things in life that turn the peasants into leaders
And we know the differences between the walkers and the sleepers

I boogie with picketer vision, carbon based stickler
City piss aroma, therapy coma, clone sitter
Itching to pigeonhole villain soul magnet
Feelers activate
Passion ate the germ, and the book met the worm
I hold a book of matches captive to flash if
The sunbeams flatline
Via thick fatigue episodes, brewed in batches
The flirt of cursed perks nursed broken skeleton patches
One muddy veteran collapsed the untapped resource center
Housing style pageants
My little limbs lasso katydid wings
While mankind's babysteps break dirt and demon
I know a crossbreed strung well in the key of
Mass times weight times tamed semantics
Encompassing that which splits lips but never supplied the bandage
To hell with plastic, we edit splendid
Tap it on the shoulder, grab it, tag it, apprehend it
Lend it to the devil to befriend it, wrench it back, mend it again
It still never renders suspended 'bove finicky picket fences
Now every droid dreams to manufacture hearts
Start with cadaver parts and a blueprint
He followed the precedent set by war pigs of a yesteryear
Let the tears braid
And skip a stone over the reservoir to shake the whole charade
Gold-plated tomb or spittoon
I couldn't see
I fell asleep holding an Appleseed, woke up holding a tree
The only bridge I ever burned along this legacy I dance
Was the one that linked the cities of Prosperity and Chance

So you want to be a carpenter, do you?
Well it takes more than a hammer, boy
You're gonna need blueprints and a will to build, and...
Straighten your cap! you look like you've been through a war
Wipe that grin off your mug, you got a sturdy frame?
Sluggish posture just won't cut it
You're gonna need schooling, and, and, and take notes!
And god if I catch you yawning again you're gonna regret ever asking for my help
And dammit you gotta hustle, this is a slacker-free zone
And, where's my pencil? Go get your hard-hat
Here's a nickel, go get us a ruler and a saw and a drill and lots of graph paper...

Yo..
I used to have a rope ladder but tattered were the rungs
I strung it from the highest willow, trying to hug the sun
The seventh level buckled and I tumbled from the summit
Now I'm back to re-climb and this time light my cigarette from it
My stitch in division/division warfare's numb enough to soak suddenly in a bullet bath and skip stones in the morning
Is a flying color phantom tantrum explicable?
Sit and pull the petals off wild flower patches, magic happens!
Behold, pity the lowlife parish?
Doom City barracks left remorse coursed on a horse-drawn carriage by the torch of Polaris
To the badlands, where every bridge collapse right where the crowd stands
Where the witches are fireproof and every preacher's a madman
Frigid be the appleseed demeanor towards the bay where the landshark Parliament swims
When they pause to polish they fins
The better brains will preach the village through the city square
To the light, heavy and middle-weight integrate
Slept with sticks and stones in my pillowcase
Ooh my born flight simulator picks barnacles off the tugboat belly
Left my spirit home in a shoebox in case I die
Got a rugged smoke-green halo floatin' inches off the swamp
Had that phase when the deviltry contacts a sparkle in my eye
Now step back from the reservoir and let the settlers drink (Right!)
Salvage all priorities and iron out all kinks (Okay!)
My house ain't made of bricks and straw but never has it crumbled (Why?)
Cause I stitched the brain's rigidity with symmetry
Come visit me, it's fascinating

Now here's how its done, I'm only gonna show you once
So pay close attention, hear me now or hear me never
Glue your little eyes to the diagram
See the plywood, the nails, the glue? You work every inch
Your domain and you must treat it well
Keep it clean or it'll swallow you whole
Where's the T-square, hand me the pliers
Now dammit, oh, this will never do!
You have to want the castle, head Up, shoulders back
Be the materials, know your limits only to break your limits
Are you listening? God dammit boy, pay attention

Try it again, little bit more juice this time
Try it again, yeah, a little bit more elbow grease this time
Try it again, concentrate, a little more focus this time
You can kick and scream and yell but damn I'm only tryin' to help
Try it again, you're not doing it right, here now, y'all watch
Try it again, stop sulking, I'm the example, for real, Watch
Try it again, I'm bout to make it easy for you y'all, just Watch
You can kick and scream and yell but damn I'm only tryin' to help

As if it didn't sting enough
The hunt dispatched a pack of wild dog silhouettes
All sulking by the skyline, focused with a bonus hunger pain
My sincere addiction imbalance stems from a vintage grimace slap to the muck of
Ancestral branch camped on the vessels
Yes and I abide, the laws of the hidden desert survived
And every peasant present teetered it on the crescent less deprived
With the exception of pleasant finale binges on the great endangered interests
Of phantom brigades slaving to save that princess
I double the negative (Double the negative), to no avail, no promised benefits
Just delegates peddling pairs of negatives
With magnified magnanimous appearance sandy sinners in opinion shut
Now what of the madness fragments?
Stagnant
How to make a vision sing while twigs cling to your pigeon wings
Fission militia, indent bent to split blood in hell's kitchen sink
Organize civility simpleton citizen mixers, then kiss the sky in unison
Sinister city-blistered corporate hooligans
All I really want's a nickel to feed my little pig
Redefine big dig, three cheers to the product
Consumer populace feed but never dreamed of the process
On a slanted advantage point saw the makeshift criminals date rape the hostage
Dream away the plain pain, yeah but it seeps through the cracks
And drips from the ceiling and smells the rich scent of my tracks
All I ever really wanted was a jungle, and a jungle I got
See it ain't the vision it's the plot that makes me stop

Try it again. I don't want to
I'm not even interested anymore
Try it one more time

Sulking in bulk and a half, sulk in a laugh, crash test
Figure the mixture's digging up his last breath
Grief leaf thief briefly turned chieftain
The tap water is on the waters off the waters leaking

So this is blue?
My frame reportedly sparred in garden variety burners and lost to normalcy
My terms the memoir, obligation the bookmark
Crystallize impurities to zero on the...
Autocrat derby catapult sponges, my hunches hurling murder abundance
Lunches where the city sump is pungent, (Curdling!)
Tomorrow sits on what the sin/consquence merger brings
To bubble up along the edges of precious child fantasy broken, broken
Hi, my name is Hazardous Tobacconist (Hi), hung on the brink
I purge a dirge and spit my lung in the sink
As for the product, well it's wrenched in a barren backward wasteland
Of shimmering moral tension adventuring to blossom pleasant
I've done it all, from pixie dust to cramming pins in voodoo dolls
And ninety-nine dreams linked on the shooting gallery wall
But it's like, not a wave crash similar to last or next
Heckle me not already doctored by regrets
Rain (rain)
Belligerent fragments bond massive
Usher in the pixels 'til the image burn classic
Bliss in a barrel and motivation in a basket
Imma cast it out to sea and wait for my karma to grasp it
I left my crutch over the rainbow with my riches
And I know the rat race of the bad taste once its grimace cringes
See, an iron butterfly will float if given good condition
But I'm still fishing the same worm from the same faulty position

(Prosperity)
Sorta makes you think

I'm a Tomahawk I walk alone and miss the bliss
Inside the accidental meeting of the pencil and the seedling
And the central started beating
Breathing at a rapid caliber
I doubt if her allotted grace will last forever more

Dusting off a dream to be an autopilot
Still a silent understudy. Funny how the opposite will throttle
And the different stroke and model to the prison
Is an accurate portrayal of inadequate betrayal of a wish

Gonna-wanna-coulda-shoulda-woulda didn't
Isn't it amusing choosing
Yet a plan is hibernating
Waiting till the mating means of motivation took a fine position
Dishing only after every little kiddy has performed

I just wanna be a general he said
I just wanna, I just wanna be a general he said
I just wanna, I just wanna be a general he said
I just wanna, I just wanna be a-
I just wanna sleep, yo

Oh, Eidolon, Capitol Crush
Gallop my chariot burning and awful enigma
Sprung by the sling of David to pierce gutter bug batch prior to hatch
Dismiss it as a soul cadets' excuse to decorate maps with thumb tacks
This gold star product pushing hate boogie themes Enter the smoke screen
Blazing saddle remnants alive analyze pensive
Connect all picket fences like chain gangs linked digging trenches
To candy land image factory. Sold

Oh, I wanna be an astronaut, I got the merits and heart
And I bought a starship with hard earned money from one hour selling dreams to dummies
When they raised the lights:
Ja-ja-Jesus Christ! I've never seen so many goblins in my life! (Oh, my lord)

Migrate through the fog and then some
Dragging bitch circuits on a short leash like organ grinder primates dancing for bread crumbs
Well, did you touch that slugger?
Banging on the table with an old tin cup, thin luck

I can raise the dead while the shocked settlers fled the blaze
Sprung out their bed of nails to spread the sails, racing for milk and bread
But I got (big) big plans. I ride a big boat with a big ol' motor
And I ain't really that big on helping you turn your leaf over

(Let's sing)
Bring out your dead, I got a pile sky high
(Let's sing)
Run if you're miserable, saw the planet fly by
My name is "Try to deny the magnificent doom craft my ragged soul built
And I'mma show you why this fucking globe tilts"

Take me where the air is clear
I don't really know where but I know its not here and
Every little step she takes makes me spin
Cause I know I'll never have to ever sleep alone again

January, I fell to the cobblestone
In April, I cut little paper flowers
In August, I drank cold tea all my lonesome
In October, I was introduced as coward
I love New York Saturdays
But Mondays last longer
And since I plan to live a long life
Maybe I'll serve a thousand Mondays and swallow the burn
To merge the week for all its got
To give my shoddy rotten ribs (thick forgot my ribs)
I got a lil' something called a spirit crisis on my skull
And it's nothing short of ferocious but I swallowed the dosage
I got a mantle, and the mantle is a candle
And my candle is a flame that burns to symbolize the day Gretel met Hansel
Then I settle in a stand still
I live forever reaching for the sun
Hoping some lucky day I'll clutch and get a handful
Rope ladder, I'm a swinging anvil
And I wanna turn skullies and tummies with pretty lullaby, bye
The way my gypsy dances makes a monster retreat to fetal
I never felt so damn young
But you don't look a day over zero
And you don't look a day in its eyes cuz it'll make you realize
The night is near so
Well then go, dream, I clean around the edges
I tidy up the tabletop, and lectured all the pledges
I never really knew the true definition of precious
Till my angel wit the beautiful red locks gave me the message
I'm a fully animated life tree
See the root of the mute button was dug up bug up on a song
Of I'm a fully animated life tree
With branches for the heavens to admire naturally

Fame, war, love, honor, crime, innocence, tragedy, sunshine
Cringe, death, passion, heroism, God, suffering, joy, fate
Destiny, treasure, stars, gall, hunger, murder, silence, mayhem
Health, pain, suspense, breath, sound, guilt, pride, time

We all know what a halo is
But we all don't know the horrors if your halo tips
I be the matador making your pretty little heels click
I be the Sword in the Stone of the contemporary eclipse
I'm incredibly exhausted
You can't imagine, got my warm spirit stuck in my teeth, I'm obsolete
Freedom freedom freedom fighter beginning
For the sake of better demeanor and such to bust, fucking fantastic
Every little step she takes breaks the chambers
In the chest, developed in the abomidable trouble
Settle for a cruel second, loud for an hour
Screamin to the beats to leave until my whole weekend turns sour
I ain't been around the world but I been around the block
I ain't seen everything but I seen enough to talk
I ain't a prophet, I ain't the Second Coming of Christ
I'm just a mason with a will to build and a little advice
I wanna weave a web, I bought a set of knitting needles
Fiddling with a theme, dream solid
Paddle in the hole-in-the-bottom dingy to where the portraits astonish
You won't regret a single solitary step, I promise
Look, in a situation where a dragon guards the gate
I make a true spur of the moment grown decision
Which in turn allows me to be something normal
With the prefix of the 'ab' and
I can kill every monster if I gotta, that's that
Rockin' it, rockin' it, clippership rockin' it
Be the little guinea pig, dig?
I'm tryin to make an exit with no ripples in the water
No splash, let the poison slide down down the hatch
It's like that

This is not your ordinary ballad
With a perfect little bow around the middle
And a black knight on a white horse
Or a white knight on a black horse
It's got all these tired parts where
We don't even sing and random
Princess raise the drawbridge
We don't serve your kind
It ends where it begins
And the beginning isn't pretty
Can't forget that not-so-perfect
Bow around the middle ('round the middle, 'round the middle...)

And it goes a little something like this..

Moon walking a broken soul pedigree incessant
Gut the cruddy frame
The zealots enveloped inside the belly of the blame
Cutthroats the result of pulp jokes soaked in poacher constants
And not a jewel amidst coal wander prominent.. honor (honor)
I bought up silkworms by the bucket like starter kits
Sew your first martyr stitch
Join damaged mammoth brigading caper
Nurse the tantrum with a fantasy chaser
I keep the spare wings strapped to my fuses
In case the hackers snatch the plumage

(So you mean these things are worth money
Now drifting off
This is the who-you-calling-homeless
Mock me fearful
Twisted mighty fearful twisted and tonight I got front row seats at the d-d-d-d-dead concert
And you're in it, Ichabod
Running out of morals for my allegory... (moseying)
My kind of people will sell only circles. (woseying)
With my eyes patched in a not so new universe
So I beckon and bray but my pretty bird just ain't muting the many...)

Oh it'll be soon (real soon)
Balloon immune to doom blend
I ain't ditchin' the kitchen 'til every spoon bends
A glance along tomorrow, sorry
Looking lot of hopefuls was the rain dance
My little flint never dreamed would flutter potable
See I sanitize nothing for the sake of contemporary taste
Contemporary taste made my lip drop in the first place (incoming)
Hmm, You want to be a Czar?, idolize fallen heroics
Recognize root of the worship, search and hold it
Who put the fun in dysfunctional?
I, prodigal son combustible, donkey-punching pinholes
In uncomfortable Zen conjunctionals for good (good)
The bear cub slop a goblet of dirt wine
I nurse a single application of introvert, serpentine

(Now a sunset without a scrape of red an-an-and a plastic bag noise
Sunk down around his head sick-sick-sick-sick...
Stealing a peak
There's sickness likeness in the roofer's eyes and his alone
And nothing terrible happened to the bag

Wrongs spilled off in...
And brought on out the clouds...
The hiss cuts out...
Spill its voice...
And the piano...
And the window full of...
Star is fresh... kept
From where I'm going... holy other
Holy other, holy other, holy other...)

B-B-B-B-B-But
I've got charcoals in my heart, I've got charcoals in my heart
I've got charcoals by the armfuls that burn my armor apart
I've got charcoals in my heart, but I've got charcoals in my heart
I've got charcoals by the armfuls that burn my armor apart

(And before, when I said 'Shut the fuck up, it's none of your business'
That was to be in vain
Be sure to lock that up when you're all finished
Finished yet? Now uhm...
I usually finish this number with uh... my skull open)

Everybody rally around the novel burners, spit, murder the matches
Where the junkies trade diseases and the gullible trade passions
Then the masses wanna lean on me like "oh captain, my captain"
Not considering maybe this orphan hosts morbid attachments...

(Button, button, who's got the button
Take my name, please...
Button, button, who's got the button
Leaks the little gentle man made of lightning inside my lock-box
Oh, you like to help with coats wait unti you see what I got in this here locket)

This is not your ordinary ballad
With a perfect little bow around the middle
And a black knight on a white horse
Or a white knight on a black horse
And I can't forget the not-so-perfect bow around the middle
Round the middle, round the middle, round the...

No more pencils, no more books
I built the city out one brick
It had a mayor and a crook
I made the crook stab the mayor then slay himself in the guilt
I stole the brick back and migrated east, now, let's build

Every tenderfoot cadet bettered slit-throat percentages
Chicken penmanship tied the thirteenth knot (Hangman)
I arrange panoramics of a placid cataloguing where wild dogs sing tailor-made lullabies tried by my offspring
I'll bring the butterflies and he can bring the centipedes
And she'll bring the cadavers set 'em free and let 'em feed
The deviltry penciled me in, but I slept thick through my alarm clock
Silly Billy hid in the barn while farmer charmed the crops
And I'm a warden
My tongue is full of glass
Because I promised my friend I'd chew up the bottle
If he truly drank the poison
I'm alienating the mating dance of the higher, ire-based, tired-faced, miser-made God clones
We can manufacture medicine
Patent the five digit slide clock the essentials in (I'll be a bill collector)
My destinies resting with red worms chewin' off the carcass anyway
Let me slay artists for tips in the penny tray
By the way if that diamond ring don't shine
That's cause I bought it at the five-and-dime but don't neglect the sentiment
I'll pedal my tricycle through the F-5 logistics of a twister
Soaked in the religions of a nit-picker


If I botched the operation I apologize (Sorry)
The err's rooted in carbon
I'm but a mortal archer parked in amber waves of starlets
I'm fresh out of Gepetto's woodwork asylum
See the frame, wire-bound knuckles
Let a tug of the puppeteer steer my hustle
Now when a page becomes a squire, be engaged, clap your wings
When a noble's demoted hope it don't sucker-punch the colony
But when the catapult releases lease your claims behind the bunker
And fasten stinger pageant results to the public eye (Glory hunter)
Is it genuine enough to feel, baby felon?
Negotiate comradery or wilt
My dismal little little loom
Purged urgent with dirty dominion monitor boxes
Hovering inches 'bove pertinent urchin toxins
(Now) You ain't excused from table side
Till the dinner plate's spotless
Slurping' liquid happy citizen enhancer
I got this slicky sycamore handshake
That mimics digit splinter entry
Thereby filtering citizens tin man prior to axe descending (Tight)
Cats know the ambiance, calm beyond comparison
Captain passive spring loaded serenity
I'm trying to give this city acupuncture
Shovin' one-way pins in subway systems
Standing up where I'm landing', now that a runway victim (Push, push)
Nature's gone batty, spreading spore legitimate
Slice the bishop, sever the ties, splinter the kinship
See every now and again I love life but hate to admit it
Cause it spreads the jinx upon a sleeping cynic

No more pencils, no more books
I built the city out one brick
I had a mayor and a crook
I made the crook stab the mayor then slay himself in the guilt
I stole the brick back and--

I'm quadruple six plus scruples category mayhem stems
From one overlooked scene including loopholes
When Christ studies the return ramifications
I'll burn the campus to impress him
Then rock like Medusa glances
Who ran the final mile before the blanks blown?
Home alone sipping beetle juice
Just to numb it, then shimmy the needles loose
I built a castle out of fifty-two cards
Plus jokers, wit, and image
Modern theory charges while remaining harnessed to the vintage
I'm valid hypothesis honoring Occam's Razor
With a seam sewn via fatigued knuckle work (Labor)
I've patched the little leakage in the shell around my greed
In case Tommy Turbulence located The Matrix that impedes
Whistle me a dirge, falcon boogie burst classic
Bastard repellent fell in haunted machines screened by similars
Got beckoned like a suicide king to the dagger surface
Due to one queen who lodged her faith inside a broken circus
Me and my stargazers from the woodwork serve the furnace
Omit the discoloring on the lung then stung the serpents
I cherish the Ferris wheel's revolutions
It's not because the ride enthralls
More simply to the fact that it still revolves
Nursed in a bracket of televis, plastics and saccharin (well)
I oppose mass panic
Thoroughbred fantasy cadets pose with a latch key demeanor
Returning to find a home vacant with no similars to compare days with
Let's build!

"This is labor"

Who put the monkey wrench in well-oiled perfectionist emblem
Just to watch these monitors spit white noise through your office space
Automater, I infect jolly gene pool descendant clown-clusters
Brushing dust mites off your starving art revolution sound jugglers
Delinquent friend from brick habitat
Bob, weave, stick, move, fence
And pause somewhere in the middle for slick invention
This years brain crops spread spectacular, I ain't mad at ya
Don't stay mad at the caliber (I twist characters like Twist characters)
Tally up the alley cat aggression in this Doug E. Fresh infested
Mess of bass line lust and automatic b-boy Krylon can combust circuit
Working these war pig cyphers with Ted Striker stability
And kamikaze chivalry
I alone noble in a worm food feud
Walking dead generation
Ain't nobody asking for your patience
The grand opening holding me to face the fact
I knew myself and didn't have to ask nobody else
(Talk about labor)
Fantastic planet urchin putting work in
Searching for pertinent verse minus the murderous diversion
Apologies won't lure me to the communal sob story
Nor will I sacrifice live style to benefit jury temperament
This old Green Goblin web cutter butts up against
Crayola daydream landscape spitting bedlam. Dead 'em
Charge the villagers nickels and nicotine to watch him fed to
One disgruntled kraken at high noon
We'll sell popcorn beer and balloons
I got an inkling this gon' be the one the children bicker over
It's that Warriors vs. Baseball Fury element
To glitch his motor sensory development
I am a star, really
That Big Bang bastard's back with a one-way ticket to beat street
This all is like, relevant to human kind supply/demand ratios, man, learn it
I work past the surface
I work on what I love, I work to service all my burdens
And I'll work until this here little flat line closes the curtains

Yes, yes, y'all, and you don't stop
And keep on, 'til the break of dawn
Yes, yes, y'all, and you don't stop
And keep on, 'til the break of dawn
Yes, yes, y'all, and you don't stop
And keep on, 'til the break of dawn
Yes, yes, y'all, and you don't stop
And keep on, 'til the break of dawn

Put one up for Shackle Me Not, clean logic procreation
I did not invent the wheel, I was the crooked spoke adjacent
While the triple sixers' lassos keep angels roped in the basement
I walk the block with a halo on a stick, poking your patience
Y'all catch a thirty second flash visual
Dirty cooperative med platoon
Bloom, head-trip split ridiculous
Fathom the splicing of first generation fuck-up
With trickle-down anti-hero smack (Kraken!)
I pace my game for zero hour completion cretin, splash
Duke of early retirement picket dream
American Nightmare hogging the screen
I'll hold the door open so you can stumble in
If you'd stop following me around the jungle gym
Now it's honor, and I spell it with the 'H' I stole from heritage
Merit crutched on the wretched refuse
From my teeming resonance
I promise, tempest tossed breed with a bleeding conscience
See, the creed accents responsive
But my spores divorced the wattage
And I'm sleeping now — wow! — yeah, the settlers laugh
You won't be laughing when your covered wagons crash
You won't be laughing when the buzzards drag your brother's flags to rags
You won't be laughing when your front lawn is spangled with epitaphs (You won't be laughing!)
Then I'll hang my boots to rest when I'm impressed
So I triple knot 'em and forgot 'em
His origami dream is beautiful
But man, those wings will never leave the ground
Without a feather and a lottery ticket, now settle down

All I ever wanted was to pick apart the day
Put the pieces back together my way
All I ever wanted was to pick apart the day
Put the pieces back together my way
All I ever wanted was to pick apart the day
Put the pieces back together my way
All I ever wanted was to pick apart the day
Put the pieces back together my way

Slacker-bound intimate tabloid headline with a pulse
Shimmy cross the centerfold, enter dead time engulfed
Divvy crumbs for the better souls
With seven deadly stains, adhere the blame to crystal conscience
The result's a lowlife countin' on one hand what he's accomplished
Okay, link me to activism chain activate street sweep
Plug deteriorating cenobite pendragon
I hock spores coursed by the morbid
Spreading of mad men, Alley gospel
Sinking your Lincoln-Log cabin and Charlie Chaplin waddle
I could zig-zag and zig 'em again
For the badge dreams sparkle in my brick wall windows
Another thick installment of one night in Gotham
Without the wretched; Houston, we have a problem
Attached to the festive batch of city goblins
Who split holiday freaks on a box cut cinema high road bellow
Head gripped, watch red bricks turn yellow
Sort of similar to most backbones at camp Icarus
Where all fiddler crabs congregate
And get pampered for bickering
Life's not a bitch, life is a beautiful woman
You only call her a bitch 'cause she won't let you get that pussy
Maybe she didn't feel y'all shared any similar interests
Or maybe you're just an asshole
Who couldn't sweet talk the princess
Kiss the speaker wire Peter/pacifism pegging threshold
Stomach full of halo kibbles
Wings span cast black upon vigils
Here to Duck Hunt ticker tape vision and pick apart the pixels
I got a friend of polar nature, and it's all peace
You and I seek similar stars but can't sit at the same feast
Metal Captain, this cat is askin' if I've seen his bit of lost passion
I told him: "Yeah," but only when I pedaled past him

All I ever wanted was to pick apart the day
Put the pieces back together my way
All I ever wanted was to pick apart the day
Put the pieces back together my way
All I ever wanted was to pick apart the day
Put the pieces back together my way
All I ever wanted was to pick apart the day
Put the pieces back together my way

Yes, yes, y'all, and you don't stop
And keep on, 'til the break of dawn
Yes, yes, y'all, and you don't stop
And keep on, 'til the break of dawn
Yes, yes, y'all, and you don't stop
And keep on, 'til the break of dawn
Yes, yes, y'all, and you don't stop
And keep on, 'til the break of dawn

Pull the pin out, sheep creep in wolf garb
Fronted by the Hail Mary parry lunge mix
Kill the populace for stability, jeopardy's a stickler
It's bob and weave amalgam played the falcon to your fixture
I branch out, arms flailing backwards
Whaling upon a tidy sound circuit, slightly foul Gershwin
With a bed of nails and drum lust, plus disgusting service
Working in shifts opposite the asbestos brain furnace
I be the now observatory: eye, ear, antenna feeler
Spitting like a dragon with a similar demeanor
Stood innocent bystand, witness the die-hard fans turn Rip Van
In the poppy fields of N.Y.'s orchestrated brick gauntlet
Now I'm thinking, "Who am I?" Jabberwocky Superfly, bent left
Pushing war without the ten step cushion, and what? (What?)
I plan to hold this B-positive sacred in these golden veins
Until the day I die from grimace overload
It's shock (It's shock)
Treatment offered by the weekend
Dystopia getaway, let's display the sequence, it goes:
One for the heartless thievery turning my guardian angel harpless
And the rest to sweep the mess under the carpet (Under the carpet)
I drag a yellow taxi meter
Behind every measure and charge cats for labeling me shepherd
"That'll be 6.50 plus tip, darling
I take cash, credit, check, money-order, gold and cigarette cartons"
Got caught up in the universe trying to zoom in on stardom
Forgot the passion plus the hatred, both were based in Carbon
Next time you wanna be a hero, try saving something other than hip-hop
And maybe hip-hop'll save you from the pit-stop
Kill 'em all, yield
(Naw, man, it wasn't me it was Holden Caulfield, brother
I just read and pulled the trigger)
Oh God, well leave me to tiptoe past the pearly gates
Capture the halo, jet back to base, step
Fast to chase the bad taste of jet lag and waste slackers
There ain't nothing broken, where you at?
The pistons pump perfect, where you at?
The bass tone is Merlin, where you at?
The services of urgent working surgeons
Purging formulas looking for an improper cause is whack

What are you saving, honestly? (Honestly, honestly)
What are you saving, honestly? (Honestly, no honestly)
What are you saving, honestly? (Damn)
Promise me you gon' shut the fuck up and recognize
What you holdin ain't really broken

I don't flick needles like my sick friend
I don't march like Beetle Bailey through a quick trend
I don't frequent church's steeples on my weekend
And I don't comment if you formulate a weak Zen
All I ever really wanted was a getaway
I'mma take a chance by letting a rook slide forward out of my hands
I cannot agree to follow a leader along a borderline
Of war without a reason for the "ready, aim, score."
Bring out your dead, we can put 'em in a pile
And burn 'em with the novels for the kiddies to admire
Kill the ones that speak from a different life brew?
I'd rather kill the noisemaker that separated the two

Okay, welcome to the Kamikaze bottle rocket cockpit
Live by the icy cold hand of bad intention youth blender
Oh, yeah, I'll let God warm the bench for now
But I'll ascend to spin y'all dizzy
(And for the record I'm bringing my TV with me)
It goes: let the commoners speak publicly
Then disperse eye jammies for cats that swear by third pupil
But can't see past the loophole
Motherfucker, my word is born like Siamese triplets
With doctor, lawyer, rocket scientist promise
(Let 'em grow leisurely)
Hey Mom, I'mma fix whatever I broke along this path
Once my spiel's perfected, I'mma save you a seat in the front row
Of Aesop Rock's twelve steps to shut the fuck up seminar
And when all these bickering crowds turn silent you gon' be proud
I tack hacks to the (backboard)
Honesty's a (patchcord)
Fury's far from (obsolete)
Serenity's a (crack whore)
Raw caricature of mayhem standard, branded by the labor
With a thousand reasons to end this for every one of you saviors
Saw the brightest burst ironically wandering the vacant stage
Gave it a pound for burning where bunk ratio's engaged
Keep me posted as to when you grasp something mature to
Sit and sulk about mister, and I'll consider picking up your record

The Orphanage, they ain't got nothin' to save
The Overground, man they ain't got nothin' to save
Def Jux, they ain't got nothin' to save
The Atoms Family, they ain't got nothin' to save
Weightless, they ain't got nothin' to save
Stronghold, man, they ain't got nothin' to save
Rhymesayers, baby, they ain't got nothin' to save
Aesop Rock, I ain't got nothin' to save
It's like that...

We'll have more news after this commercial word

(And so it goes..)
At least I think was here asleep
Is it possible? Conceivable?
That I sleepwalked out of my apartment and went berserk?

In slid rhythm, fed a cycle bound by dilemma, debt, and vendetta
Escaped briefly back to my apartment to park in front a fan
And reminisce about the day I ran a mile with your heart in my hand
Contestants get the New York home game with real life shoot 'em up-action
Thug, vagrant, yuppie and art freak game piece all included
I told this cat the Earth was flat, he walked 'till his beard grew
Long enough to strangle himself for being stupid
It's bric-a-brac novelties, spliced with that six pack odyssey
Godspeed, tequila worm future, be concerned
My feelers spread across the land reporting avalanche sightings
While my introverted side is flying cadavers on kite strings
I'm a never give, I'm juiced off projection
I'm stubborn as a thousand born-agains avoiding questions
From the alpha to the zed, I bait this data for my pledge
To bathe a traitor of the twice forgotten favors that he bled
And not a creature stirred
It reeks of subway metal, bevel edged journalist chin-on-fist shenanigans
Re-coin mayhem with bonuses, benefits and break room
Mummified mannequins with future clenched adamant
And skeleton in cabinet
This amalgam circus got a ring of fire
Just big enough to shove my purpose in the circle
I'm known to dip dusk in a broken city curfew
Release the hounds
To see which one could track your trail and serve you, sucker
I lay the law down upon its belly while my foot
Dug in between the 3rd and 4th disc yelling "Break yo' self!"
I finally actualized data commission
Past penny tip jar donation arrangement, but a far fetch from stability
Took a hard pledge early on
Blood donor to drum dozer, plowing the metronome, home
Blown caddy-cornered to cockeyed sound booster
Sensationally seismograph
Stabbing away on stone tablet to sketch a grouchy future
I drifted out the main spelunking unit with watered down
Sample of cancelled development, courtesy America
Land of the freebase, home of the triplicate grill character
My sorta sideways tilt caught pinball blinker and citizens 1-x
Weren't steadied for this leaning grievance with dilapidated winter jacket
I rock a crooked lid piece and sweat a bit to make my wookie ends meet
Pacifist willing to step into a friend's beef if needed
Wing clipper out hierarchy
Passionate while they whine on some "Daddy's gonna kill Ralphie" shit
Suck the proverbial silver spoon 'till their parents quit apparently
Parasol spinning casually like
"I'm an artist, please don't laugh at me"
OK, time to buckle the fuck down
Solder your wobbly system back to original form, pumpkin
You could catch the memoir in several dimensions
The joy-of-life logic don't employ the spite process
Hence your plight botches

This Be The Big
F-l-a-s-h-f-l-o-o-d, Flashflood

'that I Sleepwalked Out Of My Apartment And Went Berzerk'

Lucy was 7 and wore a head of blue barrettes
City born, into this world with no knowledge and no regrets
Had a piece of yellow chalk with which she'd draw upon the street
The many faces of the various locals that she would meet
There was Joshua, age 10, bully of the block
Who always took her milk money at the morning bus stop
There was Mrs. Crabtree and her poodle
She always gave a wave and holler
On her weekly trip down to the bingo parlor
And she drew
Men, women, kids, sunsets, clouds
And she drew
Skyscrapers, fruit stands, cities, towns
Always said hello to passersby
They'd ask her why she passed her time
Attaching lines to concrete, but she would only smile
Now all the other children living in or near her building
Ran around like tyrants, soaking up the open fire hydrants
They would say
"Hey, little Lucy, wanna come jump double dutch?"
Lucy would pause, look, grin and say
"I'm busy, thank you much"
Well, well, one year passed and believe it or not
She covered every last inch of the entire sidewalk
And she stopped-
"Lucy, after all this, you're just giving in today?"
She said:
"I'm not giving in, I'm finished," and walked away

1-2-3, that's the speed of the seed
A-B-C, that's the speed of the need
You can dream a little dream or you can live a little dream
I'd rather live it, cause dreamers always chase but never get it

Now Lucy was 37, and introverted somewhat
Basement apartment in the same building she grew up in
She traded in her blue barettes for long locks held up with a clip
Traded in her yellow chalk for charcoal sticks
And she drew
Little Bobby who would come to sweep the porch
And she drew
The mailman, delivered everyday at 4
Lucy had very little contact with the folks outside her cubicle day
But she found it suitable, and she liked it that way
She had a man now: Rico, similar, hermit
They would only see each other once or twice a week on purpose
They appreciated space and Rico was an artist too
So they'd connect on saturdays to share the pictures that they drew
(Look!)
Now every month or so, she'd get a knock upon the front door
Just one of the neighbors
Acting nice although she was a strange girl, really
Say, "Lucy, wanna join me for some lunch?"
Lucy would smile and say "I'm busy, thank you much"
And they would make a weird face the second the door shut
And run and tell their friends how truly crazy Lucy was
And Lucy knew what people thought but didn't care
Cuz while they spread their rumors through the street
She'd paint another masterpiece

Lucy was 87, upon her death bed
At the senior home, where she had previously checked in
Traded in the locks and clips for a head rest
Traded in the charcoal sticks for arthritis, it had to happen
And she drew no more, just sat and watched the dawn
Had a television in the room that she'd never turned on
Lucy pinned up a life worth's of pictures on the wall
And sat and smiled, looked each one over, just to laugh at it all
No Rico, he had passed, about 5 years back
So the visiting hours pulled in a big flock of nothing
She'd never spoken once throughout the spanning of her life
Until the day she leaned forward, grinned and pulled the nurse aside
And she said:
"Look, I've never had a dream in my life
Because a dream is what you wanna do, but still haven't pursued
I knew what I wanted and did it till it was done
So I've been the dream that I wanted to be since day one!"
Well!
The nurse jumped back
She'd never heard Lucy even talk
Especially words like that
She walked over to the door, and pulled it closed behind
Then Lucy blew a kiss to each one of her pictures
And she died

I start my city with a brick (one brick)
Then add another brick (two bricks)
Brick by brick I manufacture homes for fallen angels
I ain't no great Samaritan, that's just the way the game goes
Respect the polars but acknowledge middle-value rainbows
My snout turned up from dream factory eyelids
Slinging bottled prosperity for the kamikaze colonels
Yeah rocks the match that burned his Nazi journals
And plotting verticals amidst blatantly horizontal
Models then swallowed by famished potholes
And I'm tired, tied up on these functions
Killer cotton candy clouds and huckleberry justice league
Another knuckle dragger dungeon breed
Run, breathe, sit, bellow
Wild Aes scream through your style to hear the echo
Aight then, flinch for the great granddaddy payback
When Little Billy bought a tugboat
Now he thinks he's Captain Ahab
Fascist, it takes more than peg legs, birds and eye patches
Learn that lesson you'll be swashbuckling with the best of them
Wonder why you wept over spilled milk and got your crayons wet
The room reeks of a thousand bayonets
I'll fission vision with a lie longer than your most walked meridian
Connecting life with that little species of idiots
We've now officially scraped barrel bottom
Aesop Rock, an apple to the core but y'all ignored him
I know a planet made of porcelain
And once I get tired of holding this gavel up
Y'all prayer circles met him up born again
I ain't too good for tap water
Play taps out of order for a ballad, corpse a dead man walking
You can lead a man to a city, but that don't assure civility
You can beat a man to death with Aesop Rock bootleg CD's (That's more fun anyway)
Some cats float, some cats don't
I speak in Fahrenheit and burn off coal and lyric
Diss blatant harassment, spit honor, whistle fearless
Don't dismiss the billy goat appearance for that common sheep

Platforms have been erected
Effigies built
Slogans coined, songs have been written
Rumors have been circulated
Autographs faked
The hourglass smashed and didn't leave me an escape
Moving boxes have been worn out
Mantelpieces dusted
Idols idolized, the sands have been shifted
Curtains have been closed
Sleepers all waked
The hourglass smashed and didn't leave me an escape

I could make 'em all dance, or I can sleep
I can walk with a limp and make your step feel incomplete
People are made of match sticks, life is bred of flames
Noted the craft work bore the last smirk of the Damien mainframe
My boxcar siphons third rail juice from lost poets
Inhabit ocean bottom with a bin of rotten scapegoat pardons Note to self:
Don't bargain at martyr parliament rallies
Where participants squeeze in last giggle then widdle sacrificial finales
I can tie my bootlaces alone, save the knee deep offerings
Sorta brings you coughing bunk persona to light
I might, Build anti-malignant railroads, find you, and lay tracks adjacent
Just to scream "fuck off" as the engine pulls out the station
What should we do with a thousand drunken sailors?
"Kill 'em all, locate their family address, release a mailer:"

(Dear Sir or Madame, your son or daughter's embarrassed humankind
Consuming booze and gut-fuel, til their cruise had crossed the line)

I spin gold
He bats a dirty lash toward the nursery class act impressionable bubble
(Y'all could've been more subtle when polluting paradise gene puddle)
Man, huddles make us look like cool peeps and I'm trying to school sheep
Toward the right idea, see ya
This basic divine subsidiary buffs gunner syllable logic, fold origami
Plantation shut
Does this picket fence hang on to your dreams kitten?
You'll probably never hear this song
Let alone sip the mission long enough to listen

(I smoke cigarettes down to filter, smoke the filter down to space
Now I'm gonna roll this question tight and smoke that shit up in your face
Now if you were to alter masks every time fame circus approaches
Do you really think your maker wouldn't notice?)

Okay, I've died a thousand, and I'll die a thousand more
I leave footprints in fours, two for bipeds, two more to break the door
You can practically caress the utterings of crushed by drudgery
Brothers and sisters mothering stickler cabinet, mad and shit
I'll fix your wing for a penny and a parable
Yeah, but this friendship sunk with a barrel full of tarots pulled
Snake eyes harbor bad shiners
Then wonder why the cauldron sitting at the their rainbows ending
Rocks garbage bag liners garbage bag liners
I sat to breathe. Adam and Even without the Apple seed's useless
(I sat to breathe) Bashful boredom crafts a castle out of toothpicks
(I sat to breathe) I breathed too hard nearly, metamorph castle loose pins
Now I stand to breath as not to disturb the plumage
And I know that sob story, it no longer turns my stomach
Hollering wolf in the form of one frustrated culprit
Caught a love tap full of washed up stardom, melted trying to milk it
Win a ticket to ride white lines highway sideways knelt it, smelt it
One love to the rungs in my ladder, one love to the gathering of
Laughter baths that hung from my rafters
See the jackal met the badger, they were both such fucking bad asses
That clashing wouldn't make sense (hence my tape deck)
Now I ain't gonna name name's, and I ain't gonna drag others in
But I ain't about to say that I'm the only catch you got bubbling
You're lucky, somehow you've managed to befriend some good people
Who will sit and soak the evils you secrete, but why? I'm not really sure

(Knock knock. Fuck off. Kicking his lip across the floor
'til the archival vinyl venom soak the lure
Anti-clarity mechanism spit flattery burners
Fusing a million majesty murders, then stole your crown)

Oh wait, that's right, you discovered me right?
Offered up the peace pipe
Then oh, it's all cotton candy when Aesop rocked a b-line
He's acting foolish left in the middle of laying bricks
(but we weren't building nothing but a great wall around these stones and sticks)
Oh and for the record I've been rhyming since me and Andre thought we could freestyle
Built foundation out passion and brother's dusty Tascam
Studied dope rappers, vocab expansion, poems, syllable placement
You just mad because somewhere in there you came and went
(And I ain't the type to dwell) Dismissed it as casually non-compatible and bounced
Obtained status where I could straight objectively critique your after projects like
'Oh that sounds fresh' or 'Damn that shit is garbage, what happened? I'm not even laughing'
Yeah, but the barriers were broken (you choked)
You choked a few comments to the wrong Vulcan who out of respect and honor leaked your program
Now like were, both trying to sit and breathe another dawn so my advice
To you is when I say "move on" just move on

I've been a biplane dog fighter
Henson invention Trooper
Burst the result of Dragon Ball Z/Speed Racer gene splicing
Mach force, blind the extorted style from the common dirty
Destiny dream sighting, important as split the prints
God shit the planet screaming "What on Earth is that?"
I sit back five dimensions
Only to mostly over cook the specimen
Vending tragic fatality successful dodging volleys
All Hail Marys and Hello Dollies!
I flow ridiculous, indigenous to now
Who holds the fifth golden ticket?
Saw the wicked war phantom mansion beyond the pickets
The house next door to when the stickball clears the fence
Y'all hesitate to fetch it!
I was walking through a pinball tilt built landscape
Pterodactyl circling turtle
I bite the bullet in a wingspan shadow
Suck and rust the oxygen in gulps
And spit the metal directly back up the barrel
We icegrill the silhouettes (right)
The common decency factors a lowball estimate of zero
My testament is striking b-boy stances
Dancing past the foggy mirror
When wiped clean, the billy goat beard camouflage the spirit
I'm at six degrees of sexy sarcasm
Yeah never swam up inside summerjam classic
Another bent backwards bastard
Scouring the carnival grounds for an outlet
WHO THE FUCK IS AES ROCK?
I'm not a name to keep at arms length
Adjacent to little Linus quilt makeshift
Sick security mechanism, check your mission
I am not a vision, check your mission
Just a simple sourpatch delinquent
No it will not help you shove your Lincoln

I alone settle
I alone peddle in the mud
I alone, I condone rebel zone planting
I alone stand in a social coma
All up to your dome, follow I alone

Now you see me, now you don't

Well he was maverick enough but still scraped up
Taki 183 innovation for the kids
Brick foot ironlung honor
Escape through the night like a disgruntled teen Krylon bomber
Without a care, aside from posting the roster
Mal-adjusted blank faced civilian dispersed feelings
Reeling in several separate defunct fame-booster modules
This nervous twitch mark the most delectable ingredient
See Aesop starving troopers in cell blocks with strap-on feeding bins
(More like) Like I'd auction off a fuck for that blind cause you ride in
I'd rather find the flaws and watch you hide 'em
Feel the haggard look penetrate brain castle
Blasting clear out the back of this batches sour wind collection
(FLASH FLOODER!)
You're a fuckin wind-up toy
A goddamn four string criminal trading card
The reason they decorate the fonts of closing credits
To boost on-looker amusement after fading hard
Catch more Z's than Rip Van Winkle's 12 Step Narcolepsy Seminar
Action! we all compete the masked illusion
The commonfolk, I provoke em all
Challenge dirty balance
I elope with talent while they fidget
If the revolution ain't gon' be televised
Then fuck, I'll probably miss it

Yo change the fucking channel
I burn a Coma candle
When the flame fades, consider my flatline a soldier's sample
We them cats talking noise behind that New York trash heap
Where the stench of commuter briefcase replaces a bad sleep
And it's, worker zig-zagers versus piggy badge flashers
Training Generation Fallout
Waterfall bricklayer pincushion crawl out
There's smoke in my iris
But I painted a sunny day on the insides of my eyelids
So I'm ready now (What you ready for?)
I'm ready for life in this city
And my wings have grown almost enough to lift me
I'm a dinosaur with Jones Beach in my hourglass
Passing the time with serial killer coloringbooks and bags of marbles
Don't tell me you ain't the droid that held the match to the charcoals
Don't tell me Lucifer and God don't carpool
(This is our school)
I'm not trying to graduate to life at the personalized barstool
Head in a jar on the desk, feet dangling in a shark pool
(Man please) Man please
My name stands for my being
And my being stands for the woman who stood
And braved the storm to raise the seedling
(Brother, sun, sister, moon, mother beautiful)
Yeah middle sibling suitable but far from son of excellence
Back in a long time ago, I was to way the wishes wish
But missers miss, I slept through my appointment
Saw the liquid dreams of a thousand babies solidify
And picked the rose that wilted
The second I introduced myself as Nervous
Well it appears the scars of learning have spoken
Some are burning, some have frozen
Some deserve tall tales, some wrote them
Some are just a brutal repercussion of devotion
Mine are all of the above cuz everything leads to erosion
Now where I live there's a homeless man, he sits upon a crate
He makes a rusty trumpet sound like the music that angels make
Now if you ever come and visit me, I suggest you watch the show
Tell him Aesop Rock sent ya just to hear his horn blow like this

And I ain't getting any younger
My knuckles wear their bruises well
I've yet to lose that hunger
But only time can tell
Prodigal Son with a prodigal wish to sew that prodigal stitch
And crucify bigot voodoo doll on two popsicle sticks
See your name is Ambiguity
My name is something hands can't hold
But hearts part ocean scapes just to watch the starlet unfold
It's like sketching a circle in the dirt with a pointed stick
Knowing the wind'll kill it some day, still it calls my burning wits for now
And if I plow the fields that don't guarantee plentiful harvest
But starving artists die, I set my alarm for five o'clock
Idols block survival crops the cycle stops for nothing
The Bible's carp revivalist winos flock by the hundreds
To the opening, scarlet carpets greeting their duel
Leading the stubborn mule to cruel rugburn
But y'all numb from gut fuel
I administer eclipse, there ain't no motor like a martyr-made motor
Cuz a martyr-made motor don't quit
I am an epiphany, I am webbed foot mammal
Channel surfing my way to the top
Tugboat in a bottle
With no holes poked in the nozzle
I fed em bedlam diluted in limelight
Till that rookie boogie graduated hostile
And the vehicle is grandeur and it veered over the median
The second my halo ran outta helium
Demoted to thorn crown, damn talk about numbskull
I was born bound to a stencil called symmetry
But my energy's a rental
So I take this now to say
Thank you senorita for holding a flame to a lost wick
Thank you James Anthony for the band-aids on my ego
Y'all are family for life
I'll take that bullet to preserve you
I wanna be something spectacular
On the day the sun runs outta batteries
Attach my fashion to the casualties of anarchy
Save my nickels up to buy that homeless man a brand new horn
Then sit up on his crate as I witness the beauty born like this
(I ain't gettin' any younger)

Raw, I'mma give it to ya, no trivia
Raw like that Aesop rock iron-fisted bliss militia
A bent funny bone, drone community
Spit a thousand and one ripples to cripple the continuity
Tapwater builds character. Right
I irrigate it straight to mainline
You want to do the same? Fine
These pretty profit grommet teams solidify to clot the slippery city sump piston pump drain
Behold "Old King Credible". Kind soul with a Russian-roulette bad mood spin-off
Where every day, a thousand strangers pray for empty chambers
One sixth buckle
Five sixths sweat bullets trying to keep it subtle
But I'll get you (I'mma get at you)
My novelty, wobbly rope bridge broke inches prior to dry land
But duck skull stepping-stones suit the mix down well
Well, when the rumor spreads that y'all stupid
I'll be the cat with guilty look on face and shirt that reads, "I didn't do it"
God, is it on? Is it beyond basic?
Does it ice-grill you? Or is every song faceless?
Does it have a title? If it didn't would you name it?
Does it babble about nothing like a drunk atheist?
We could run that Orwell's '84 warp for the Room 101 detour
Until each client fidgets with his or her own worst fear specifics
Swerve around the cobra kisses
See if the venom overloads this vision, I'mma suck the poison out and spit it
Stole my sneakers but your feet just never fit in
Serves you right for trying to walk a mile outside your limits
I'mma tiptoe across this yo-yo string
Until you walk the dog out from under my feet and skip town, sit down

It goes boom boom boom (x4)
Boombox (x4)
C'mon

Earth to A.R. vertical
Burden has increased at an alarming rate
Bliss is down a point, murder up, glee down, and still falling
Still crawling out of bed at 2 on Saturdays came this blind soldier-burning confessional
Ease back, let a heart thump echo normalcy for 10
Let the back burner boiling point descend
I race the derby in the first heat (strike personal)
Strike personal space with a most utterly putrid version of grace
Spit the gimmick, sit and fidget wild
In five you'll be jumping through hoops like Coney Island freak show midgets
Want to be a fighter pilot?
Driving that childish early Wright Brothers experiment prototypic model fossil
Sitting sweating bullets on a console
Busting accidental dirt bike donuts outside the most ridiculous poison tongue brain silo
Dead before the chubby debutante conquered the high note
Schooled by the cruel intention invention's pensive sideshow
See contrary to popular certainty, I alone advance
Without an earthly poem, and dance on a handful of zoning fans
Combing every chance to own the land, I roam with dome in hand
And truly be its only camper happy with the scrap heap
See I convince myself it's on, therefore it is
And the melody settles beneath the fact that I'm just spitting for these kids
I tried to get 'em all open, and once I quit and said I didn't care
That's when they all threw their hands in the air

Yo
I take 10 steps with a bent left vision
Study the disorders we've absorbed inside the village
I understand the plagues and why they shake hands with my grimace
Then remain up in my face like top to bottom train car fill-ins
Let's question the ascension of a broken social icon and bury its domino affect
I'mma blow this hex over the mission
Just to administer the end-all sucker punch toward its pitiful condition

It goes thieves, bandits, low lives, scum
Punks that buckle under the rumble of my drum
Steadily searching for something new under the sun
But its stagnant, active element first of madness

Thieves, bandits, low lives, scum
Punks that buckle under the rumble of my drum
Steadily searching for something new under the sun
But its hurtin, act of development first diversion

Yeah, its like sloooowww dooowwwn
You're movin much too fast to bust through the finale fashioned glass
Its delicate demeanor and I teach you how to hang
But we like 1970 something 20 kliks outside Da Nang (Dear Obedience)
I apologize for the faulty academics
But they placed us in a miserable stasis
I let bygones be bygones
But tryin to see eye to eye with the faceless
Just ain't working the way the manual paints it
See I soak in a blue note factory
While most cats hassle bandits lamping (?) solo
And when the last red brick topples over the earth
To intercept your crooked little mess
I can be found in a social coma directly to your left
Engaged in a conversation, a marvel with my breath
Regarding how to document the shady baby steps
I bounce checks like a modern man
Sleep with one eye open while the other two drift
Together specimens from the promised land
This for the thinkers
This for the urchins allergic to they own stingers
This for the absurd verdict linkers
This for that cat at my shows that's always got prophetic opinions
But can't remember where his drink is
I'm wallowing, shrugging I'm plugging your corporation
Cause we alley cats addicted to the sickly warped sensation
Answer this: when all is said and done
Are you a memorable trooper or just a lab rat on the run
Choose one

Jiggy-jabberjaw vitamin idol and primal rages
When bible page verse tidal waves begun (Water won)
I wrote the book that shook America to splinters
In a winter wasteland icicle-bound barren township
Call Baron Münchhausen and proud gimps to clinch this chemical war pig
Delinquent sinking like a paper tugboat well beneath your holidays
Beached on a red tide infested shore corroding eastern seaboard beauty
I'm a jigsaw slab, but all the pig saw was dirt bag

It's like a bleeding comet bombing on your sequels
To the Riverside Park Tunnel people claim last lifeform standing
Carbon based pardons ain't enough
My stilts truly personify this urbanite flea circus
We urchins merkin on daily
I catapult brain opera past basic
Tear my own face off in the finale, stick around it's ill
Diabolic Prodigal Son spill grimmace
If you had one more eye, you'd be a Cyclops
Which explains missing the premise
Bliss mimic, baptise, chastise, laugh, die
Kiss the finish, piss the villagers the fuck off
Pete Piper picked peppers, and Run rocked rhymes
Aes Rock might've smoked one too many dimes in his time
Now, where you gonna be when the sun falls, brother?
Probably gathering your sheep with all these other motherfuckers
Struck twice in the same place by a moody Zeus fishliner
Smackin the third clear out the park
Going gone (To infinity and beyond!)
I rocked for a flock of Chewbacca look-alikes in magic makers
Hermit crabs and New York city sewer aligators
Keep your Honalee dreams out your homily
I deal with tangible goods
And avoid manufacturing food for landfills
I've seen friends bow to needles
I've seen needles bow to records
I've seen boughs break
I've seen God bow and make the clouds shake
I've seen the proud break
I've seen alot for a blind soldier
Who tattooed a cityscape on skin to blend in
The rats travel by night and fight the waterbugs
I'm here to pull the three-prong on this prime directive wormhole of self-sacrifice
Add a hatchet slice for kicks
And so that God-awful Frankenstein scar on your style can someday be a story for my kids
Life's hard, life's easy
Life's everyting in between
Life's Peachy like James and the Giant
And I keep spittin as long as these kittens buy it
And I keep casting my line as long as these fish will bite it
And I like it (Don't try it like that)

"Yes the bough is low
That's the way it goes though....
Maybe I should just give up or stop trying
But life is so uncertain, so short
I've got to keep on searching
And wherever it takes me, I've got to go"

Bantamweight temper tantrum, decrepit anthem
Set a low goal, I arrive late
I'm here to scrape a cog clean till the funk machine
Imposes on the underling amalgam cluster and identifies the mother
(Oh you got heart?)
I hate to tell you but it skips more than it palpitates
Like these here drunken little archers miss more than they calculate
The falcon hates the mockingbird
The farmer hates the drought
I hate em all, I kick the bottom brick out shouting "Yes y'all"
And blow the village out perspective (Aesop!)
Do you take this makeshift Candy Land cult-classic bastard style
To be your lawfully wedded head trip
To embrace throughout sickness, health, electrical storm
Fire, pain, rain, hail, wind, ice, sleet, snow? (Hell no!)
I'm balanced, personified phantom to the bone
Walkin like a Jabberwocky
Scalpin a pair of one-way tickets to shadowboxing
It’s just like Christmas with a shallow stocking
Like this (I'm just trying to milk the mileage)
You drop science like Don Herbert with liquor in him
Soundin' off like senior citizens sitting at Bingo parlor bickering
Yeah, it's kinda funny, isn't it?
How I can build while you just sit there and bitch about your syllabus

Dwarfed by the lights, bewildered by the fanbase
Bound by an idea, skeptical of the handshakes

Skeptical of the handshakes

Zoom in to the fuming of an aggravated breed
Via the study of post-adolescent agitated seeds
Half the patients wasted self prior to Commencement
So I focus on the urban Oxygen samples, the half that made it breathe
They sold Pompeii impression, waste infections
And twelve steps to lesson
Cretins swiftly tippy toe on hard to swallow, barter concepts
The give-it get-it, never let it self passport our stubbornness
Martyrs talks money causes in a harvesting Spartacus
And so on I've thrown long Hail Mary bombs
Toward cookie-cutter Mother Natures bedazzled synthetic fabrics
Life treats the peasants like
They tried to fuck his woman while he slept inside
Well they're merely chasing perfectionist emblems
When the clock strikes nine
I'll be waking with the best of routine caffeine team players
For the cycle of it
Under a dusted angel heart string Big Brother is watching
My odometer like buzzard to fallen elk, talking stealth
We got babies, rubber stamps, and briefcase parts
We on some door-to-door now
Order ten dollars or more, we'll shove it down your throat for free
I'll sacrifice my inborn tendencies
For copper pennies for one commanding "Gimme that"
So we can retain baby fat
Make the biter snake bedlam
Holocaust freak, heckle shiesty brain headroom shaped planet
Make a move, pause, make a move break cannon
Bent barrel one eight zero, you'll turn, squeeze, end it
It's on like it's never been
It's bleeding well
It's bigger than a breadbox
It corrodes my leaky finance
I'll take my seat atop the Brooklyn Bridge
With a Coke and a bag of chips
To watch a thousand lemmings plummet just because
The first one slipped
Sometimes I laugh at victory, kissing these little question marks
I tend to underestimate my average
Just another bastard savage
Someday you'll all eat out of my cold hand
Cuz every dog has its day
At which point, I'll pull it away

Now we the American working population
Hate the fact that eight hours a day
Is wasted on chasing the dream of someone that isn't us
And we may not hate our jobs
But we hate jobs in general
That don't have to do with fighting our own causes
We the American working population
Hate the nine-to-five day-in day-out
When we'd rather be supporting ourselves
By being paid to perfect the pastimes
That we have harbored based solely on the fact
That it makes us smile if it sounds dope

It's the year of the silkworm
Everything I built burned yesterday
Let's display the purpose that these stilts serve
Elevate the spreading of the silk germ
Trying to weave a web but all that I believe in is dead
Nah brother, it's the year of the jackal
Saddle up on high horse
My torch forced Polaris embarrassed
Shackle up the hassle by the dooming legend marriage
I bought some new sneakers
I just hope my legacy matches
It's the year of the landshark
Dry as sand, parched, damn get these men some water
They're out there being slaughtered
In meaningless wars so you don't have to bother
And can sit and soak the idiotbox trying to fuck their daughters
Man it's the year of the Orphan
Seated adjacent to the firefly circling the torches on your porches
Trying to guard the fortress of a king they've never seen or met
But all are trained to murder at the first sign of a threat
Maybe it's the year of the waterbug
Cockroach utter thug specimen
Fury spawned from dreaming of your next of kin
I'm still dealing with this mess I'm in
I've been the object of your ridicule
You've been a bitch lieutenant
God, it's the year of the underpaid employee
Spittin' forty plus a week
And tryin' to rape Earth on my off time
You bored dizzy, I can't keep myself busy enough
So you can run run run
And I'mma let you think you won
EVERYBODY!

We the American working population
Hate the fact that eight hours a day
Is wasted on chasing the dream of someone that isn't us
And we may not hate our jobs
But we hate jobs in general
That don't have to do with fighting our own causes
We the American working population
Hate the nine to five day-in day-out
But we'd rather be supporting ourselves
By being paid to perfect the pastimes
That we have harbored based solely on the fact
That it makes us smile if it sounds dope

Fumble outta bed and stumble to the kitchen
Pour myself a cup of ambition and
Yawn and stretch and my life is a mess and
If I never make it home today, God bless
Fumble outta bed and stumble to the kitchen
Pour myself a cup of ambition and
Yawn and stretch and my life is a mess and
If I never make it home today, God bless

I don't shrug. I study the ramifications of my shovel
Loving the consequence of uprooting the jungle
I'm hugging the cycle of Gemini's duplicate tenants for muting the puzzle
I don't budge the motives
Encased inside the gauntlet's hunger quotas
I don't shrug. I study the ramifications of my shovel
Loving the consequence of uprooting the jungle
I'm hugging the cycle of Gemini's duplicate tenants for muting the puzzle
I don't budge the motives
Encased inside the gauntlet's hunger quotas

My kitchen sink leaks like you're itching to speak your secret
'bout the world spins yet nobody's pledged allegiance and why
His beaming smile knew a private agony that burns
And when the children met divinity I sat to watch the merge
It goes pandemonium live
Ya'll mutha fuckers stand up. Volunteer tantrums while your plan sunk, vivid
Play your sympathy card, son of misery classed with
The basket cases is in a classless matrix with elastic patience
I zig in a zagging only zone
Draggin a bag of lonely poem remnants
Short of breath like you're short of fresh
You're a portable mess
Carpetbagger spearheading tear peddeling pretentious art critics, orphans
Trying to dismiss those pioneering their fortunes
You're a spectacle
Pushin for pedagogue lacin up paper weights walkin on stilts talking
You touched the hand of God and I'm like
What are all these evils that plagued the hearts of man
By sweet talking border patrol until they fold and let them in
You got your life in a basket before you could say instant classic
Like the king of the mountain requires a boost
I'll bury the hook in my belly just to volunteer at live bait clinics
For the thrill of 9 great mimics with 18 bloody lips, spittin
Beanstalk, chalking outlines before figures fly
Walking uphill trying to get down
Prominent ghost town litigate battle pitch darkness
When the light switch hits the artistry circuit board breaker
Service in the greater half of nature
See money go wild shook when the exploitation incubated lovely
Warmingly piggy leader colony to comfort
Numb enough to deny the sin pins and evil needles even punctured
Till he woke to find his tourniquet still functions

I don't shrug. I study the ramifications of my shovel
Loving the consequence of uprooting the jungle
I'm hugging the cycle of Gemini's duplicate tenants for muting the puzzle
I don't budge the motives
Encased inside the gauntlet's hunger quotas
I don't shrug. I study the ramifications of my shovel
Loving the consequence of uprooting the jungle
I'm hugging the cycle of Gemini's duplicate tenants for muting the puzzle
I don't budge the motives
Encased inside the gauntlet's hunger quotas

Burn burn em mostly
Stuck unplucking plumage out the poultry
Soaking in bulk on a sofa with ductape upholstery
Dirty doc stellar space medic
Stoned by the commoners for glowing
Psuedo floaters buy them beats till bloated
Happy trail hitchhikers guide to spanning oblivion
Complete with a thankless 9-5 chapter
You can sign your life after the fact
Wicked soldiers pickin with buddy system
Logistic motors like Noah's ark ticket holders, pivot
All in a days breath
I guess
Sandman here to foreshadow a day when television run over baboon heart transplants
Sketching a glass partially empty till their hand cramps
With an iceman's chance in Dante's dreamland to stand where the fans lamp
But maybe I do
Yeah yeah maybe it's all over
Maybe I won the game before the machine ate my quarter
I mean absorbing attention's a must
You don't wanna be overlooked
Yeah but you don't wanna be looked over too much
One up for the dashed hopes of fifty fishermen who crashed boats
And the angels who never hit bad notes when harmonizing
I'm an armor-plated farmer
I'm an archer rising with a drawn bow
For the karma where the bulls eye clings and argues
Dense, spreads like new names at the writers bench
Either you drink it or sink it, coz there ain't no sitting on the fence
You make me chuckle child, it's Hell's kitchen now, miss
Recognize your life is merely bait for bigger fish

I don't shrug. I study the ramifications of my shovel
Loving the consequence of uprooting the jungle
I'm hugging the cycle of Gemini's duplicate tenants for muting the puzzle
I don't budge the motives
Encased inside the gauntlet's hunger quotas

Ugh, encased inside the gauntlet's hunger quotas
Encased inside the gauntlet's hunger quotas

That jackhammer is so real

Diamond cutter spine
Armadillo armor that bends around the blades
Bugs in the beard
Ebony in the lungpiece
Bricks in the Timbs
Bazooka in the tooth that he's flashing at your friends
This is the lifestyle, baby
No insipid recipes
Not a single innocuous atom in the centerpiece
Oh my god!
Journalists across the globe are officially critiquing my first eight bars

Piety for the fam, embargo piggybackers
Navigate sim-city backwards
Bazooka Tooth, baby!
Zephyrs less detrimental expect to tone down terrordome for starter crews
Like jousting Pompeii with a garden hose
If you wake up to the sound of helicopters bumping Wagner
It's Bodycast the Pilates class
Rumble in the Bronx back alley batting cage with bottle smash
Drag them prophecies
Be them celestine or Mothman to the bumper boat monster mash
You see the pristine kittens fiddle with new yarn
Decrepit sickly dogs get shot behind the barn
One champ put in long hours like Tim Leary's lava lamps
Just to be second headlined under the boy born with lobster hands
Isolated, biological phenomenon
Verse nocturnally orchestrated car alarms
Y'all sketch portraits of your neighbors, tack 'em up without fail
See a row of red pitchforks and bifurcated tails
Official Max Fischer-Blume brake cable clipper (Def)
Picket train buffer, the riverboat, and the switcher (Jux)
Pipe-dream of that so fresh and so clean plumage
As an appleseed aborted resorts to Bazooka Tooth shit

You don't want me smiling at your cameras

I cut the ropes breathe
Fresh puddles of pigeon blood and smoke. Load bazooka
Scoped the culprit hulks over a broken hookah
Got rebel camps with siphons amped to cookie-cut the wattage
Electric ilk NY raised on b-movie sluts and gossip
Conditioned the bodega rodent moment composure to echo numb and uncommon, dumb monkey pollen
My 23's lean over a cobra motor milligram bender, novelty
I tip lids prior to clipping the comradery
Check the muck out
When metal maggots burrow in Promised Land vein division I tug my brim down over my astigmatism, low pro
Paxil Rose, Axl broke and butchered
Last catapult standing in a land of coke and hookers
King Kong potluck, no parking for rickshaw loads of sock puppets and sitcoms
Just Krylon pigs bred in a hot boxed wigwam
Serotonin deficient teens demonstrate ease in the modern day Uzi purchase
The foundation of their alacrity makes the mothers nervous
Me? Oh I check the newest murals to see whose still bombing this fucker and um respect”
Find out what it means to me, New York
Walk blocks with electric ninjas who bark/bounce for trunked out whips
Like, "My company DeLorean's the shit"
Skipper's out of happy pills again
He's in the neighbors garbage. (Ahh Skippy)
He's making paper dolls decorated with targets (Don't do it)
He's labeling the dolls with the names of shitty rap artists (Nooo)
Then tearing out the still-beating heart from the loose-leaf carcass
I ordered a hovercraft off the back page of an Archie comic
Built it in three days to float above snarky comments
My gills call the East River rock bottom home with three-eyed guppies and seahorse mutations
See, New York is ancient Rome. Basic. Basically stone. Faces
My friend jumped off the Empire State Building while I hung with 10th grade head cases
"Some of them will blossom famous", some of them will blossom baseheads
But they all rep rivets in the die-cast metal Voltron cadence, what?

N, Y, Electric, Catalog, Burners, Pigs, Magnums, Crack, Bag lady, Roach bait, Pristine kicks, Thread and the iris of the needle
Imma thread the needle
Imma thread the needle
Imma thread the needle
Imma thread the needle
Here we go
Dah dah dah, dah dah dah
Dah dah dah, dah dah dah
Breaker 1-9, 9-11-01 witness, maybe you don't get this

Kill 'em all slow
I was on a serious tree bender with my hands up at a C-Rayz-Walz show
Nether-circuit bacon don't police me anymore
Your trained professionals demonstrate 41 shots over par
Least common denominator raise truth like Charlie, Willy and Gramps raise roofs in a glass Wonkavator (Monster Maker)
Operate wild by the company of unturned stones and litter
Talk his way out of a sunburn and be home in time for dinner
Paid dues since before the days of bad acid and Quaaludes
While the boombox talks trash to the Richter
Stalking awkward with a zip lock on the pill hole
Bitter fucker, nothing is free
I'll spend my last dollar on me
Put one up for my family, should've made time to thank 'em
Put one up for my crew, for recognizing the sanctum
Put one up for the socially broke, choked and smoky New York piss hiss bleed Dolby, homey

Cameras or guns one of y'all is gonna' shoot me to death
Just know that shit

I take it easy...

Upside-down I pick wings from beetles
Pry 'em out and pin 'em to the pole over the see-saw
Sofa cobra shimmy out crater
Cradle my weight in double wishbone suspension
Versus AM clock radio bangers

Downside-up in crippled acres
And still the fountainhead spittles sniglets
Quicker than quidditch seekers snatch golden snitches
You could be a part of it
Just park your bark at 20 paces
Hold this target and we'll call this bitch a partnership

Man! the city bred the brittle cheapo
Little Lego people squeezing little Lego Polaroid in keyhole
Media breather needy burrow to hide all
While you friends and neighbors press stethoscopes to the drywall
Curl a worm tongue tight, bitten behind the vamp chopper foaming
Lamb choppy sock puppet fear and loathing
Need phoners a.s.a.p. to build careers out of misquoting
So I read Aesop interviews and get schooled on my own motives

It's a pocketful of nickels, like Cool Hand Luke decapitating
Parking meters when the pigs blew the whistles like windmills
I went to jail overnight for putting a sticker on a phone booth
Now in the time that you did the paperwork
How many'd the rapists merk?

Panicky banister silver surf over the wobbles where the potholes
Be the ulcer in the stomach of the God show
You blinded by the light you might just plummet through the cosmos
Meet Apollo sandman function before the whore hit the high note

I take it easy, the ice is thinning in the valley of the jeep beats
And when the freaks come out I hug a TV
Somehow a channel zero bender's less creepy, it's bliss
Repeat with a twist...
Ea-sy
When every martian in the market holler feed me
The all-city opinion spigot leaky
You learn more when your mouth piece retreat, it's bliss
Now listen to this...oh OK
All day every day, oh all right, all night every night

Whose capitán gon' spew stale venom? Not mine...
I hug a hammock in the bedlam
And when the potentially lucrative race horse gets deaded
I'll wake up for a second to help the betters count their blessings
But I cannot Cratchet crutch the Ebenezer limbs much longer
Flaccid flimsy songbirds, classic dizzy wrong turns
For the long term got a dragon all achy
Torn between the lending of a helping five knuckles
And a charter your own escape
Now it's like, sufferin' succotash, bucko, ducks in the chuckle patch
10-4 on that, stinger operation, wingman double back
Fuck it, Let him roam the home of the mange ridden emaciated
Slave pain cave children game
Not all players heal the same!

Learn it or don't learn shit
My radio is on regardless
I tune out pardons and tune in starlets
Carbon and pre-David/Goliath live Paleolithic bias
Who walks on all fours dragging the cadaver of King Midas
Now it's Thor dwarf war hammers, Elvin bow and arrow aimers
Documentation of the rate at which narrow tapers
Hermit crab, honest cat, trying to raise the roof in my own TV room
And still get the security deposit back
Call Ripley, Skippy
Motorhead dope fixture on some 'Go to bed, no dinner!
Hold your head, cold winter!'
Ease up out of the ghastly, desert dozer cliques stranded on cloud 8
Proud of their pogo sticks, I stay left
Along came a spider, sprung and alert, I stay def
He makes records with his tongue in the dirt
Suffer the dirty earth crisis with a license to flirt
Buffer the mighty tighty sequins with a price on the merch
Covert Mr. Blizzard shoulder, he always acts all pissy
Plus your friend said I was an asshole when he met me
No bad moods aloud when you're in the public eye
Kill it, you are the weakest link, goodbye

Burn train buffers
My fancy
Up jumps the boogie delivering eye jammies
Walk through the muck with a clutch on a trident
Never give a fuck how far Pi went
You are dealing with a reborn icicle age poltergeist

Uprock, sidewalk cycles stuck at the bus stop
Wookie foot must not sleep
Under the invaders
No batteries
No jumper cables

Wired under-agers play box cutter face-lift
Rock utter makeshift spirit
To y'all I'm just a funny moniker with a couple of fresh records
And a bangin' hand style to put the jukies On the guest list

Walk for that
Metal train graf brainiac
Walk for them
Not a limelight
More to blush alizarin crimson
When the multi million
Tin men suck traditional rituals
Out the homes of starving children
And I bet they can see the city bleeding from the satellites
Formed by the corporate war drums recorded poorly
Dirty dub vamp
Bruised by the hues of wicked pallets
Chewed by the tooth of livid maggots
Dino DNA and cola, straight no chaser
Mars attacks colorfulness
I piss raptors on motherships

Hazy days will stay purple
Cause Cips with a Z bargain
Like Crazy Eddie commercials

Go Ah AH AHH AHHH
Network with a dirt devil
Burn train buffers
Hi!
Cute the way your little parasol spins
Bye!
Suck my Neanderthal dick
Catapults spit
Losing the screws and bolts
And all they heard's crews gulp in bulk and sulk in volts
Zap!

Suicidal eye full of plastic nine

Cave paintings get the natural history feather dust
Pick a lust

Limo tint stretch DeLorean chrome sittin' on twenties
Then I walk to the stouge, burning my laundry
Lo Pro
Fucked up jeans back at the party spinning Kane meets Flight of the Valkryies in a heartbeat
Saber tooth, catalog, city art, liturgy
Ranger Ricks endanger the clique maximum efficiency
And isn't that dope?
The line of blind winged Pygars and how they wallow planks into the matmos
Binder bibles and a graphite prison violator
With Joshua for the war gamer systems

Now the architects are rioting cause we built something different
I'm like how the fuck sure shot evolution not my business?

My elephant television was on
Grape soda, Grape ape, Great space coaster
DnD, GI Joe, Transformer, Herculiod, ThunderCat, Voltron, Speed Racer, Space Ghoster
Kiss the flickering images with Carroll Ann fingertips
C-4 to four chamber skips
Ohh shit...
They say his eyes were spiraling back when he hit the mat
Woke first words: "Oh it's like that?"
Started bendin' spoons and rippin' arrows outa lady hawks
With a C3P unit tryin' to interpret the baby talk

Burn train buffers
Right turn woulda missed the iceberg, fine

Pain cave uno
Smokin' a broken Blue Note
Tar pit escape artist carcass, linger in the bulldoze
Rose radio Lazarus via linear bark screaming
"I'm back to kill the video star and I'm double parked"

OK, the web (web) spread (spread) from Brooklynites to born in barn kittens
Who's gimpy half step hid behind Noah's Arc systems
Inconspicuously clustered with the boas, sharks and pigeons
Like Zoo York won't clock them rusted crutches up mopping the ship deck
Texas hold 'em pocket ace investment
Totem altimeter tiki torch it
Freak abort, fold or hold a cold cell in peak enforcement fortress

Pseudo Pliskins O.D. on kick drums

I skunk the blood up as to numb the public interface
Before the anime corrodes I'm tryin' to fork the figure eights
Hogwash etiquette, truncate long haul leverage picket
Outbuild auto-bricklayers with 10 guerrilla digits
A the Don Darko, bark O beautiful piranha gossip
Cobwebs on the Kafka, choke up on watcher logic
With a left-center field indicator gesture gently
Smash when the 101-octane hemlock tea pumps chest to extremities
And phenom limp it to the wicked recon
Prowler fist up with a Bowser twist vs. America's kooky coward clips
(Pump breaks, cupcake) I melt through the father formula
Goofus murked Gallant, the missing link was apparent
Drugstore cowboy, hold floors and grudges
Fuck the Judy piece while Elroy burgle space cakes from the cupboard
I could kill a cockroach with only Wallabees and rug burn
Pin 'em down and funnel up boric acid chuggers if stubborn
Mash jackals, hacks flash Bedazzlers
Capture flags and crash test happy campers
For the typecast ponies grazing through the weekend
Ring alarms with bassy kicks that flip whips on the Major Deegon
Left out of dodge nauseous (I don't feel good)
Yo El, leave the keys to the Delorian with Lauren at the office
I peak the 88 streak off with a fiery disposition
And basic serotonin deficient symptoms

Alpha uno compute (Aesop)

Hung off the balcony by the skin off his doctor's psyche
He hopes it holds but knows the locusts kamikaze nightly
He woke, promoted bug-eat-face, insect chopper's biting
He's only bones by the time the ungodly body's sighted
He saw the puddle, full color hideous monster Viking
He used to survey if the vermin dined on others like him
He found the fucks indigenous to him and awfully feisty
He grew old awkward grinch and settled into bonkers nicely

Unruley mayor souse, who piggy jammy happy shooting at the bladed mouth
Bazooka Tooth zoo-keep the paper route with janky funds and favors
Cradled by twelve empty Zelda heart containers
Man, it's freezing in this brick bitch, winter forever
Like Punxatawny Phil found with his four furry wrists severed
I walk face-first through the sex, drugs, and church
With wild things that make Maurice Sendak question his early works
But no hostages, no promises

Twisty, fishy, contradicty, wild animal ship fleet
Off the sliding board dock of the Mr. Turtle pool mom bought
Somewhere they laminate dry bones in cool water and ease medulla

I'd duel too, but only to exploit no-brainers
Teenager beef passed alligator teeth and extra-curricular flagpole scrapping
Amongst tadpoles it happens

Okay, the moments were subtle, but unstolen, and guess who owns them?
No friendly, non-threatening corporate, lacky-mucks, in the totem
Lucy was In the Sky with Diamonds,five dollars to hold 'em
The summer, Van Eek beat Pac-Man, with acid behind his molars
Little white tab tolerant, little white flag, waggling
Inorganic, pat on back, trim the panic, flat on backer
Back to back like Mad Hatter magic, rabid mastiff collaborative - Splatter,bachelor fabric fatter, with cabbage patch lit
Dark days, Ben and Louie-Louie, park blazed, chemically -
Bent-up but eager to crash for that one, two, three repeater
Good Morning Vietnam!Whose couch is this? Whose house is this?
Who are you down with bitch?I'm sorry, dog, I dreamt the foulest shit
There was this rabid foot talisman, drowning out of my armspan
What's fouler, was the other farmhand's growing gills, and shark fangs
What's fouler, was my torso stripped to ribbons, in the marshlands
But I'm up now
Let's get this window pane, and shut the fuck down
Down by the river, where the litter sits -
And lion-heart critters, smoke dope, and act like illiterates
I ran with a brat pack of loose bolts, and high social maladjust-ees
Sacred, numb and boundless went to St. Protocol, cut me, well -
I was dummy to some, when the tongue was cradled, and my skin looks crazy
Pocketbook mirror courtesy Amy,spiders in the -Mattress,paisley sunglasses, dilated eyes green
Ice grill that could burn through, your picture-in-picture widescreen

Only the illest beats leak absurdly out the boombox
The Daytripper anthem goes: wake, drop, walk to aquarium
Whistle while you work, like a canary lung,"All work -And no play makes Jack a dull boy", to carry drugs
I sorta see it, as my last blast in summer (Uhn!)
Skateboards and sloppy psychedelics and big numbers
Good times, good people,all airbrushed -

And I knew the permanancy would drift
And I knew the pH balance wasn't right
And I knew the crash and burn, how to caress it
L.S.D. flashed the message
And I knew the gash wasn't gonna stop bleeding
And I knew the ph balance wasn't right
And I knew how September would then affect it
L.S.D

Lazy summer days
Like some decrepit landshark dumb luck squad dog lurks sicker deluded
Last sturdy domino lean's secluded
Don't let stupid delusions lesson super-duty labor students
Dragnet lifer solutions
Daddy loved sloppy dimensions like son-daughter links
Such determinated lepers, successfully disheveled
Little soliders developed like serpents despite life sentence ducking
Lemmings
Some don't like sobriety's dirty lenses
Some do
Let sleeping dogs lie still
Don't look so damn lackluster

Sharks or jets
His bark mark targets where the barnacles nest
They burrow deep under the carnivore's flesh

Spoon up the ballooning for high noon saloony antics
Walk off with a thumbs up
And a stuffed Bullwinkle trinket
Pull twinkle out them awestruck baby sockets for a day
Yeah that's the ticket
Yeah that's the pipe dream
That's hater 101 bitch pigs
Living guilt trips for the fan base family picnic

Now it's randomly fantasy beef stew
That's panicky pre-school
That's Keebler signs Pikachu

Add the chrome fangs I'll rewrite Heavy Metal Parking Lot
That's why these grapevines could pop shit to me all day
I only kick these fucking doors down to make sure the crew o.k
Like, food on the plate
Thread on the back
Kicks on the palette
I rock the bells without clown shoes, fried dough, tickets or mallets
While the bearded ladies won goldfish from the ping-pong toss challenge
Threw like girls and misconstrued the lucky fuck floaters for talent
It's sad really...
O.k., I'm over it
Smolder over composure models like smoke over soldier nostrils
3d bifocal goggle broke over cat walkers
There must've been something up in that Long Island tap water
Grew to mute Grinch north of Who-ville and his frisky sissy poodle pack
Oozing that hollow 'who the mac?' act Aes threw back in junior rap
Isn't it strange how it's a fad to bite your idols
When the whole reason you liked 'em was cuz their shit wasn't recycled?
Come pigeonhole Aesop like he ain't heard it
That's no burden
Need attention?
Better dress them diversions like stripping nurses
Kid the cult is thick and media's the sacrificial virgin
Purging little man behind curtain opinions
This is perfect
Look I'm just like y'all
Living low-pro to paycheck
And when the landlord hollers he hid the 'dro in the tape deck
Rocket radio
Every success smidgen he harnessed
Parks with risk and sick with it clicking in perfect working ratio
No frisky out of dodge name blame for sneaky plots
With elevated rung placement derived from deep-rooted jealousy issues
He cue the raging bull and every due is paid in full
With that I forget all you motherfucks that failed to pull
Why? Well
What's really good?
Not a cat who peddles backwards for a hacker's filthy looks
Hodge-podge menamena-Muppets available in rubber stamp form
Hogwash Harry clamp norm
Wear the space cake baker?
Order up
Curb his pacemaker
And vacate personal space in relation to face-raker
Built an Einstein-Rosen bridge to '88 with Lincoln Logs and bobby pins
Probably when Oz's friends slept on the poppy stems
Horseback 60 M.P.H
One hand rolling tobaccy badly
But it burns out cavalry of concerned worms for mayor
But you'll find validity in a penny, right
And I got a clear flick of the Loch Ness sucking off Yeti

With a knee-jerk response to his budgetary woes
He's hooky out the institution's huckleberry mold
Style leapt out a Hermann Rorschach margin mark
Starving art smashy to slash a martyr heart
Trashy to lap her garter belt
This is 6 flags Definitive Jux baby
We like, love it or leave it out your holler box now
Cripple a kitten if a kitten is a culprit
You're spilling insignificant frijoles

We rolling now, official?
Uhuh, uhuh
Turn the beat up a little
Uhuh, uhuh
Outside the box, Lif you with me? Yeeah I'm with ya
Aright, let's go

Some cats grow by the laws of the wild
Some learn slower and lag in the mud
Some stand up in defense of a style
Some let the big dogs eat them up
At exactly 11:35pm on January 21st I fell asleep sound
At exactly 11:35pm on Januray 21st some shit went down

Now Benny was a New York City graff kingpin
Five borough fame, guaranteed to itch pigskin
Raided near the Brooklyn Naval yard, juxed undercover
When they asked him what he pled he said, "You're fuckin' up my colors!"

Miss Molly, helpless, made a penny with a data entry temp gig
Overqualified but the rent's thick
Red brick bash with a texted green screen
Like, "I entered my data right into your screen"

Billy was a coke fiend
Maggie was a cop
For the dope he stole cream
She patroled the block
Banking off his old scheme
She recognized his plot
He thought he was home free
She knew that he was not
Now it's off to the jail in a blue squad car
She pocketed the crack before they got far
Billy watches Maggie from behind steel bars
Like "Where the crack went?"
"I'ma smoke it tomorrah"

They call him Larry Luck
Blackjack, big spender
He was married once
Till he bet her ring finger
Seen leaving Las Vegas
With a pick up truck, diamond
Fourty large, and beautiful wife piece
Less than what he came with
Hitched to the crib found nickels in the couch
Hitched back to the casino with in an hour
Said "I'm here to make a dollar out of fifteen cents"
And was immediately shot to his death over debts

Now, J.J. punch drunk, acts like a dumb fuck
Bum touched girls looking young enough to thumb suck
Once sought a life thought it right to rat him out
Now gets raped by Aryans in the big house (OUCH!)

Some cats grow by the laws of the wild
Some learn slower and lag in the mud
Some stand up in defense of a style
Some let the big dogs eat them up
At exactly 11:35pm on January 21st I fell asleep sound
At exactly 11:35pm on January 21st some shit went down

I got one Jack or Jill
Jill won't, Jack will
Jill didn't, then did it
Jack fell
No cellophane secrets, b
I guess I sense two felt bumps in the tar
No cell
But hell, you jump the bar so well
Parted your partners veil and dipped
I'm New York harbor
Tale of a sail, ripped sorta
Stuck on purpose for tha love of birthplace
But would have carried you home inside of my teeth anyday
Turns out I wasn't cast in the master plan anyway
He holds no grudge, holds his tongue, wow
Same one she used to hold in both smiles
Dagger the instinctual last shout if it killed me
So you can ride up in the sun city guilt-free
One year passed, the table is wobbling and your hollerin' back
Sippin the fits you skip when shit cracks
They never missed it
Not a long haul, bullshit, kids kicked into the sink
Shoebox, with a flicks of lipstick
I'll love you forever, cuz you know me better
For the record, at one time, would have married you in a second
But kill the rekindling dreams, and navigate the friendship
Or else by the time the stress airs out we'll both be dead and friendless

Every leader dead and it's making you upset
La da de dah da da, La da de da da da dow dom
Set, set, set...
Every hero dead and it's making you forget
Get, get, get
La da de dah da da, La da de da da da dow dom

I'm in and out a pig channel serrated for hand feeders
Army of vicious kitchen patrol yam peelers
They sleep in barns and whisper loony conspiracy secrets
Increasing payroll awareness blind while a.w.o.l. went the leaders
The only mammal officially banned from food chain comp
For finishing for over 25 consecutive years on top is aggravated
Alarmingly, the pulse don't bump right
And he's up nights
Bumping over crunk and bug bites
Who luck like this evening?
Stay electric mud blood jockeying for the footing
My last supper starts with a vinaigrette over pickled Muppet hearts while sheep tuck deep in the wood chipper
For the shepherd was a milk carton and scissors
Clammy hands make henna run on risky jenga tugs: you're all sweating, Hell I'm sweatin' too, just ain't nobody sweatin' you!
(Holmes!)
The muck went abacus on labor perspirator official biz
When auditioning demos by which to live
No whammies, Stop
Your triple six game never chose me
Trickery gets hokey
Pick up sticks and ponies
You've got mail, champ: blow me
Just trooper with a question mark machine needy
Pointed at the heavens like a Bee Gee on some where the hell's my freebee?
To clamp war stupid
No landlords or super
No hands
Water no ice cubes Rubik, no plans
No motor movement, no dance, no pyrotechnics to enhance
No chance
Too many grown men call in sick over cramps
I weigh in heavy on the jaded bitter subtracting the frontal gimmick
I want to solve world hunger and fuck a pin-up
I want to find a 21st century carbon crutch worthy of pedestal placement and shitty path walking to touch

(Baddest motherfucker touching down on kick drums)

Ain't no time to sit and lift stones
So it's left to the dogs to find their way home
And you grew up in a similar generation alone
With a fist full of humanoid models along the road
But a blank and you're ancient
Fuck if I can find a flesh and bone tour guide to edge me through the makeshift
Every little footprint’s faded and vacant
Now I stomp through this motherfucker impatient

For the first time in a long line of dog fights
Little Lassie will not be returning home tonight
They’re saying someone everclear spiked the punchbowl of Christ but all I saw was six pits ripping throat box out her life
Live lizard lung out a this ain’t Kansas cause
Where the lemmings run with scissors to the closest open jaws
Pause
Open the fucking door Hal, it’s your valid mistake
I will not bow to a god that I can’t look in the face
It go C-4 tongue and a janky ankle
He still escort an Eeyore to the seafloor, thank you
Please curb your Egor
Alto spas Alcatraz to the peace core
Anti bleep. Anti sheep
Sword anti sheathed for corroded shoulders to lean toward
Short ‘em, sort of report consecutive awkward moments like Gandhi and Hitler stuck in elevators broken
One could reach the ceiling panel boosted by the other, but suddenly suffocating doesn’t seem all that stubborn
Is you with it? It’s brick Timb on eggshell percentages
Only mobile at but a trotter’s clip
No dial tone or walking stick. Fostered chickies peel back a placenta with broke posture for the daily dun da da’s done didn’t glow proper
From the promised land abortion of keepers and bleeding orphans
Where only the megas creep outside the box to seize the fortress
I and my crew seek an informal enforcement passage after receiving a timeline laced with tutor muter packages. Come on baby, act with us. The other activists, refusing to pour dummy accusations to the aqueducts
These are the days when the flotsam and the jetsam part ways trying to convince the players to fuck the game
But we don’t want to trouble you
We take no for an answer
If and only if enhanced with 'k' and 'w'
We’re only warning kitten paws who want escorting through the jungle zoo
This little industry will buckle you

(Baddest motherfucker touching down on kick drums)

These lil', lil' fuckin' Martians
You gotta love em' though

Mars attacks wit' electric gats
Not for sapien abduction (what's up then?!)
Billy took a laser to the mug piece; hollowed out the mandible
Channel headquarters, order the cannonballs (Mars attacksssss)
BFI demands column to this pigeon ankle
And boomeranging' our harvest; 51st area sickness
Not a threat, nary a witness won't injure the promise
Monster lead- carry your ligament fanged in the mosh pit
Dodge phaser, labor days are major A, sir
Cater the alien decomposer soldier platter like Caddy Shack eight
I told her "Go for C4 magic's"
Smolder as did Bazooka Tooth holster fabric
(This fucker's rabid and still breathing!) (Hiding cabbage!)
Oh, the heater claps to leave me
I'mma ninja this shit with sugar in the fuel tank of the saucer
Buddy up and head down to the metal corporate tunnels
Ice pick the soldered ship wiring; pissed off the mother and um
I'd be lying if I said I knew your intentions
See my sexy sabotage thinks defensive action'll save the race
You lend a hand on board to mention magma (Blaze the place!)
Spread fire of your revival, there's wires in your Bible
Obviously, ultra tech advanced when I point-counterpoint
Comparison of ET vs. little old freak me (She be on somethin')
Hey riddle sweet peas wit' your nickel PCs, fickle CDs, miserable TV sitcom (Typical!) Pathetic ritual collective slackership
Beautiful establishment; you ain't established shit! I consider you foul
Prowl back to the numbers under burnt pride in the dark (Sup, y'all!)
They want us dead or alive without the alive part!
The sun rose over a body bag shortage
Last week I was like "God bless the saint that invented the cordless."
This week I sorta re-routed of the bull's-eye of my worship:
Temple-body slash full cabinet master my diversions
Fuck y'all, lets do this shit; My movement soothes any space invader practice
Stomped up to enemy like "Hey what now, bitch!?
I am human, hear me rise above material and cardinal sin."
They shot me in the face:

Mars wins. (Mars wins. Mars wins. Mars wins. Mars wins...)

(God morning, sir. May I show you something? Sir.)
(Jet-black smoke on the horizon.) Black smoke in the air
Maaaaaaaaaaarrrrrrrrrrrrrrsssss wins! (I thought you would like it.)
Who you screaming at dog? I got this! (Let's go.)

Zig zag 'zooka, pinnacle stitch
Unleash the unlimited edish primitive piss
I slip a cynical Mickey to most military ops
Monkey - here's how the filament drops
We on a pre-three prong ancient elephant tusk
Betamax fully, break bread
You shruggin' it off, keep it electric, sure
But NY Electric's not about electric war
It's "hunt, gather", see the poor man's clan set bait (Last page!)
Three, two, one, domesticate!
In the corner of the cave reinventing the wheel and roll out funny
Sitting on them Barney Rubble twenties, subtle;
Sipping saber tooth blood puddle-
I could roll with the lackey's, that's if we hustle
Knuckle in the mud, hell's bells in the chuckle
Red-berried face means smudge around the muzzle
I'm allergic to the now-born solar panel cuddle
Stole cold to the core, dirt menace
Stone cold sans Alcor cryogenics - stubborn
Can't talk shit with a tongue full of rug burn
Got bad cholesterol, good blood sugar;
Four-piece heartbeats wit' a subwoofer!
I'm not asking you to act like you notice (Oh, Aesop's SO Mesozoic.)
And now I see that cabinets pills be old (Potent!)
Open the mirrors while I pulse with the voltage
Keeping me alive is the vibe with the Vulcan's hope!
Tangle the vine catapult (Catapult!)
I break it down to the bones of the crux with the goals of the age old
Eat. Sleep. Fuck
Structural droids; more bounce for the buck
But they want a last stegosaurs - thorns in its butt (buck wit' it!)
Prehistoric land shark business, cradled in the arms of the karma and kismet
Swarm to the sickly thawed out the glacier
Beggin' for the freezer burn; back every day, sir!
Sir, your science loves to fuck nature
Sir, your right to the dawn of my day, sir
Sir, your violent lab coat and beak can vivisect witches til we all catch vapors
(GIVE HIM)
Don't call it a sound-off, "Mars Attacks" be the malarkey downfall
(ONE)
It's not a game no more, run from the flash, leave your panic at the door
(THESE)
A lotta of magic gadgets, give em all back just to nullify the savage
(PILLS)
Mics crumble if we rock 'em right
In the year of the troglodyte
Saw a grey mouse gravy poured on a board
To the dull morose world like a lull in a storm
And I know you was hopin' that the piece for the ox was a dull sword, Ahk
Guess what: it's not! Guess what else: I transmit for the block!
T-Rex - X-Ray with triple X Hex (give it up!)
For the yesterdays, or the next I can assure you if there is I got the sword
(dead flesh!)

Ain't no time left. (Keep ya head up now)
Maaaaarrrrrrrrssss wins! (I thought you would like it)
Saw a- a bleak ending real quick

Hunters with their dogs and deer rifles
Thousands of them line the pavement
Like patient pupae waiting to become worms

The people are dead, but the money keeps talking keep-keeps-keep-keeps talking
The people are dead, but the money keeps talking, keep
Keeps-keep-keeps talking

(Another dark night) Teething I'm marking a beast sheep
Like I walk in front of 39 thieves in a "v"
Smores over warm helvetica brown proper
For the odd God or monster, propped to teleprompter
Wild blue yonder, blue in the face, angel
Blew into the bugles in lieu of the euthanasia
Usually the shooter community chew the corpse
But I see the wolves have already gotten to you and yours
Day of the dead, play the ledge closely
Train a barrel of monkeys to aim at the lowest bogey
Dope the gonzo I've always felt choked socially
Stole the golden fleece with the culture of total nobodies
Earth rised, divided by fighting tribes
All we do is watch 'em waddle back and forth lighting fires
(Money money)
Detonator, wire cutter, pliers
Two cities enter, one is broken up in tiny tiles
And I wonʼt pose arm in the heart of the lionʼs throat
For a photographic token of my primordial growth
You parade around and kill, so damn proud
Like a flatline fetish, had it's feathers fanned out
War taught him symmetry, skipped into it gingerly
Silk worms ping-pong ministry to ministry
Hell's bells every which way the the wind blows
So I bang my head against any wall you can build, go

Another dark night, another not alright
Another bad ritual, more botched surgery
Better follow the bread crumbs back in fact, urgently
Or waddle through this section where the natives feel "murdery"
Vicinity wander, claim no soul
Never let an anchor drop
Never had a home, never talk to strangers
Never trust a friend
This is the life and the life will not end

Money

Next time think
39 thieves are quicker than 40 winks...
Raise your drinks
39 thieves are quicker than 40 winks

We're not concerned with the community aloofness
Dude, we're animals, we just go where the most food is
Lower the toast, most formal etiquette is useless
Truth is you're equally expendable if spoon-fed
(Money money)
Money is cool, I'm only human
But they use it as a tool to make the workers feel excluded
Like the shinier the jewel the more exclusive the troop is
Bullets don't take bribes stupid, they shoot shit

(Another dark night)
Calicos tread around the rabbit hole
Weapons to the heavens and arsenic where the carrots grows
Piss warm sugar water, what a summer canteen
Plus burned rubber like "green is the new green"
Rubber neck froze, slows by the multiplex
Rodeo commotion, I'm open to see what culminates
Bougie on the right, left rep rebel force
Both say the feud will prove the parking lot was never yours
Black top pebble wars
Soldiers molded where the jonesʼs every grown-up
Wants decoded came to grow in
No motive, it showed up in gross quotas
Hog barn burner come see if your homes hold us
Eighty-five rattle-trap parked and fancy
You could swear he was stepping out of Comanche, antsy
Let us in the jetty when they jettison the medicine
And paranormal hatchet and cadets to break the levees in
(Money money)
Both know the totem camaraderie
Token of equality, they post it horizontally
Crown the golden loading dock, they crawl to lodge the colony
Half-mast flags, half cabs loiter properly
And sleep the sleep of the just ready on the left
Where the witchcraft spun out of a neighboring sect
With the usual undesirables and the big brother cutters
On the day your name became "This Motherfucker?"

This-is-the-life 
The people are dead, but the money keeps talking 
This-is-the-life
Talking 
This-is-the-life
Money money 
This-is-the-life

Flash that buttery gold
Jittery zeitgeist, wither by the watering hole, what a patrol
What are we to Heart Huckabee, art fuckery suddenly
Not enough young in his lung for the water wings
Colorfully vulgar poacher, out of mulch
Like, "I'ma pull the pulse out a soldier and bolt."
Fine, sign of the time we elapse
When a primate climb up a spine and attach
Eye for an eye, by the bog life swamps and vines
They get a rise out of frogs and flies
So when a dogfight's hog-tied prize sort of costs a life
The mouths water on a fork and knife
And the allure isn't right
No score on a war-torn beach
Where the cash cow's actually beef
Blood turns wine when it leak for police
Like, "That's not a riot; it's a feast, let's eat!"

And I will remember your name and face
On the day you are judged by the funhouse cast
And I will rejoice in your fall from grace
With a cane to the sky, like, "None shall pass."
None shall pass, none shall pass

Now, if you never had a day a snow cone couldn't fix
You wouldn't relate to the rogue vocoder blitz
How he spoke through a NoDoz motor on the fritz
‘Cause he wouldn't play rollover fetch like a bitch
And express no regrets, though he isn't worth a homeowner's piss
To the jokers who pose by the glitz
Fine, sign of the swine in the swarm
When a king is a whore who comply and conform
Miles outside of the eye of the storm
With a siphon to lure out a prize and award
While avoiding the vile and bazaar that is violence and war
True blue triumph is more
Like, "Wait, let him snake up out of the centerfold
Let it break the walls of Jericho, ready go."
Sat where the old, cardboard city folk
Swap tales with heads, like every other penny throw

And I will remember your name and face
On the day you are judged by The Funhouse cast
And I will rejoice in your fall from grace
With a cane to the sky, like, "None shall pass."
None shall pass, none shall pass

You tried, you tried, you tried to trick me
You've got a, you've, you've got a, a lot of nerve
I'm, I'm not, I'm not, trying to trick you
I'm try, I'm try, I'm trying to help

Okay, woke to a grocery list, goes like this
Duty and death; anyone object, come stand in the way
You could be my little Snake River Canyon today
And I ran with a chain of commands
And a jetpack strapped where the backstab lands if it can
Fine, sign of the vibe in the crowd
When I cut a belly open to find what climb out
That's quite a bit of gusto he muster up
To make a dark horse rush, like, "Enough's enough!"
It must've struck a nerve so they huff and puff
'Til all the king's men fluster and clusterfuck
And it's a beautiful thing
To my people who keep an impressive wingspan
Even when the cubicle shrink
You got to pull up the intruder by the root of the weed
N.Y. Chew through the machine

And I will remember your name and face
On the day you are judged by The Funhouse cast
And I will rejoice in your fall from grace
With a cane to the sky, like, "None shall pass."
None shall pass, none shall pass

Reeeeeemix!
...Throw your babies in the air

Dead men tell no tales (Uh-huh)
Up push the daisies till the soil is stale
In a powder blue tux for the farmer's sale (Here we go)
Mr. Big sleep with the carp and kelp

Once upon a time in the days of yore
When the people lived fresh outta legend and folklore
There was an old pirate who piloted vile slang
Had a bird perched on him and swash buckled the same
Peg leg navigate him starboard to port
By the nautical starry night yelling "The harbor is yours!"
And you should tell them where you situate the gold
That is unless you'd like a vacation with Davy J-J-J-Jones
Like "walk the plank" for whom the shark thank
Maroon the mutineers consume the souvenirs
And while the shiny spoils piled higher every year
He was suffocating slow in the box of a buccaneer
Ten summers prior on a night like this
Crows nest scopes something afloat to the boats west
Swore it blew him a kiss
When he focus seen the face of an angel upon the body of a
F-f-f-fish
"What the heck!" frazzled, his telescope shattered
Gathered himself she was ghost he was down the rope ladder
To deck circled the vessel 360 swiftly
Found nothing in the water but salt, piss and whiskey
Yarr, heckled by the swabbies at the bar
He'll be the laughing stock of the Barbary Coast War
Like this dude either got two glass eyes
Or he wearing his patch on the wrong s-s-s-side
Now he knew what he saw
But had to prove he was raw
So he raped and he pillaged and
And he feud and he brawled
Try to rekindle his rep via sabers and gun smoke
And vowed to always find her though he never told his cutthroats
Meanwhile, back in the now, got a brand new skeleton crew
On the move out when they aren't manning thirty burning cannons stern and bow
They are prying shiny metals out your m-m-m-mouth
Okay, youth wanes old age holler wisdom and disease
Like the scurvy made his yellow gums bleed
And he was achy from his boots to the feather in his hat
Until his quartermaster showed up with a stolen treasure map
One look down and lept off the dock
See if you can guess where X marked the spot
The capital was buried at sea in a cursed cave
Only one mile from where he'd seen the mer-mer-mer-maid
Anchors up, hoist the jolly roger thank you much
Day and night with his hook hands raised and clutched
But see the vitamin deficiency was strong
So by the time they bumped into the island he could barely lift his grog
Crawled off the boat, collapsed in the sand
Prayers in the air, seashells in his hand
And nary a high tide so grand as the one that put
The lady of the lake on dry la-la-la-land
I wish I could tell you that it ended happy
Pretend like his bones weren't practically snapping
Pretend like her gills didn't dry up and suffer
But that's a half-dead pirate and a fish outta water
No lie, scout's honor, got a million more
From the burgundy lighting above the shores of whores
Before your visions of grandeur go to swell those sails
Remember dead men tell no t-t-t-tales

Dead men tell no tales
..Dead men tell no tales
..Dead men tell no tales

Sharks in the dunk tank, vipers in the garden
Locusts stole the groceries out the local Farmer's Market
All God's critters hold positions
Some are violent, some are victims
Each alive is an equal and vital piston I support
So when the piranhas honor New York
My daddy long legs dangled and mangled for sport
And while I bring in every dink in the kingdom with open wings
It all boils down to them shit-soaked pigs
The pigs (what), the pigs (what), the dregs of what y'all aim for
The gluttonous muddy stomachs under the pudgy cakehole
Two-track braniac using the food and payroll
To chew up and consume every cookie, crumb, and peso
And place a cloven hoof on the lucrative when convenient
As the bourbon-odor smokers' coughs smolder off the Cohiba
If Noah had the benefit of hindsight on his ship
He could've snatched two unicorns and left behind the motherfucking...

Pigs!
God damn... pigs!
Potbelly... pigs!
Punch-drunk... pigs!
Take money, money... pigs!
Loudmouth... pigs!
Wide load... pigs!
Let's make a deal...

When all the wolves in woolly wigs
Have huffed, and puffed, and blew the bricks
The skulls of Brooklyn's cruelest pigs
Will rain on Fulton's newest kicks
As mulish swine of all surrounding counties sniff the gruesomeness
We pass around the pineapples and pull the pins in unison
I will gladly feed you to the breed who wants you sacrificed
No pagan or sacrilege, just bacon for scavengers
I will gladly seat you with the chickens, not the passengers
Hopefully the crack in his armor spreads to his avarice
Never that, Wilburs multiply quicker than triples
And hunt their truffles in fistfuls, but it was all bells and whistles
Bougie this and Bougie that...
War pig or pussy cat...
Glitzy to the pork ribs, had to gold-leaf the booby traps
Powder-pink, double-breasted, mess of mud and money
Waddle off the fire to make his stubborn tummy wroggle
And while I don't really know the working details of your tribes
I know that that's one ugly fucking tie
Asshole...

Apple in his mouth, Maraschino eyes
Party like the butcher boy's cleaver is alive
I mosey into sixteen hours of smoke in the misty winter
To see the county fair's blue ribbon winner as dinner
Then dance until the sun has kissed your blisters in the morning
As the misery was dormant and digging in crispy portions
Corporates want to lure him in and whore him. Or does he whore the corparates to expand the more important forums for him
Push the mortar pestle past the ordinary orchard
When the frilly border's faded is the product mine or yours, pig?
Mine, plus I toss a token where I go:
Directly to the worms who shovel shit and yellow snow
This little piggy went to the market with a target
And will subsequently know the armor-piercing forks of farmers
Final words for the finer birds taking notes:
I dig a chick in pig tails, "That's all Folks!"

For want of a nail the shoe was lost
For want of a shoe the horse was lost
For want of a horse the rider was lost
For want of a rider the battle was lost
For want of a battle the kingdom was lost
And all for the want of a horseshoe nail

There is a hole in front of the shovel
Shovel in front of the brawn
Six billion gorillas for whom the graves yawn
Each within his mulish days to choose his tool of trade
Dueling blades that cued a cruel charade and fuel the flames
Few would clue the crew into the civil
Skip the food and land like you the man
Who flew the coop over the pitbulls
Dash back flashy to compassionate nanopolice who sat beneath an avalanche of jagged inadequacies
And I was "Stop the Violence" more than I was Pontius Pilate
Cops and robbers riot by the five's obnoxious sirens
A is gullible he figure, "all man equal, no brainer"
Take it his friends and neighbors didn't cater
Moms raised the babies through a very churchy 80's
Sunday mornings reinforce the waiting gates of Hades
And he brazen but apparently inferno bound now
For when a man of cloth recite his wrongs he wouldn't bow down
The punishment should fit the reasons you must punish him
Never puncture skin or pull the colored rugs from under them
Two opposing mother ships shall not employ the gunners deck
Cause brotherhoods of public good do not employ the unctuous
And you. observe and have the givetheth disproportionate
To the taketh away decide to maketh his day (do it)
All the stoic odium glow in a cold holster
To where he coulda stood easily in the tub jugglin toasters

No mountain too high
No city too far
No coma tonight
No city tomorrow
No fire too live
No city too charred
No treaty to sign
No city to guard

I picked the phone up with a grown-up mode approach
Skin crawlin off the drawl and now I claw the awkward tone up
I'd known it wasn't roses
But hoped it was less corrosive
Coastin to the focus of the grossest diagnosis
Like homes, the barnacles that chew upon the flesh of man
Have clued into the suitor was capital to a beggar's hand
And uncomfortably. sung a stubborn legacy of gluttony
With carnivores that burrow like hunters into the blood in meat - umm, what?
Chinny chin-up and the city picked this
In a pent-up letter numbed the spitting stigma
Along came a spider, sold her eggs to any buyer
Now to shoot a ringer back with six legs wider than the driver
If you make no friends on the way to the top rung
There is no secret handshake club I do not give a fuck
But know the cancers make the olive branches obviously standard
So when they extend from the yachts and mansions drop your canons
All kings hang em for the cliffs side drip dry
Will he clip the zipline or slip for his final dip dive?
If he live will he survive the milligrams of middle-ground
They pump into the pin-striped pentagrams over Tinsel-town
Or kill a man who trickled down the city with his scissors out
Or sickles, dipped in military hells bells and whistles
Riders to the east, not a wild tribes
Thank you for the peace on earth and mercy miles high

No mountain too high
No city too far
No coma tonight
No city tomorrow
No fire too live
No city too charred
No treaty to sign
No city to guard

(Good evening
All right
Yeah
Happy to be breathing
Yeah
I am alive
Yeah
Yeah)

"You look like you've seen a ghost"

Are you asleep?
Or are you
Are you awake?
Nah, man, I'm done
I'm showered, I'm everything
Ate some fuckin' Lucky Charms
Let's go

Most copious
Rains soaked the opiates
Notice how the phobias appropriately procreate
Woke up with a ghost farm
Focused on his groceries
When they aren't telling stories, they are multiplying grossly
On the lawn
Let 'em loiter, never let 'em spawn
The apparitions have been drinking his water for too long
So when they gathered by the birdbath in the morning, he would tell 'em
"I mean no disrespect but you have all outstayed your welcome"
Interesting in a sense
Interrupt commiserating phantoms on your picket fence
How quickly they will lift their heads
And breathe an ultimatum like the dead don't argue
Said, "You're living by the bayonet (but how alive are you?)"
Shit, A is all juice and bad etiquette
Elbows on the table
Lobster bibbin' on the ready set
He said, "But how alive?"
I dunno, homie, you decide
(No, you decide) Fine
How alive? Too alive
(How alive?) Too alive
(How alive?) Too alive
And one by one around the yard 'til each one felt communal pride
Like they had done their little part in cleaning up the public
With a steaming plate of justice for them Easy Baker stomachs (Say what?)
We the legends that hunt with the unremembered
Geriatric lore in the clutch of the budding censor
Who snuck around the art police and all related governments
To infiltrate a human lung and hike up off his tongue and lip
Ahh, money's in the market for a mothership
To double as a vessel that drag his legacy under it
And who am I to hang him out to dry by the heat
When, if rehydrating fails, we're all dumber because of me?
Zombies of the antiquated nation chatter quietly
The "Too alive" channel from the library of rivalry
And summers in the mud (Mud)
Winters by the tracks (Tracks)
No story goes untold
Aes is back

I got a handful rockin' the same poker-face
Down to dance around the table like they own the place

"You look like you've seen a ghost"

I got the whole world thinkin' it's a holiday
'Cause they can smell the chum in the water from miles away

"You look like you've seen a ghost"

(How alive?) Too alive
(How alive?) Too alive
(How alive?) Too alive
(How alive?) Too alive
(How alive?) Too alive
(How alive?) Too alive
(How alive?) Too alive
(How alive?) Too alive

Before shooting troops was cooler than hula hoops
High noon was your basic who's who of brutal truth
Hot summer gun or box-cutter slow dance
Turn a young'n to a dozen paper dolls holding hands
And tricky was a wooden horse pushed up on your porch
So chicanery was yours to engage or ignore
I was on the latter, but a lot adopt pawns
So we carried lawn chairs and buckets of popcorn
(Pass the popcorn) Brawl fair, cop car
Voyeur hawk him out his hinges, storm door splinters
Clamoring about, hammers out about to ring
Infiltrate each others tribes and murder each others queens
Packed to the very last rafter
Clung to the rafts and the cameras to capture the damage
Neck swivel with a chop chop volley
Where the ants leave nothing, but the bones and the car keys
Pardon if his two feet fester, it was rude of me people, meet left and lefter
Planted like a model of civility and honor for the sector
But never got his extra extra
Peace for the better but it wasn't entertaining
So they waited for the tazing from the safety of his haven
Like bees to the honey when they lumped you up
Cause bumper cars are only funny when they bump
Know that...

Hot summer gun or box-cutter slow dance- popcorn, popcorn...
Hot summer gun or box-cutter slow dance- capture the damage

(Yo, this dude talks real slow yo... Crazy
Yeah man that's my boy Steve; he just talks like that, it's weird
That is weird.)

Each one teach one how to club one- popcorn, popcorn...
Each one teach one how to club one- popcorn... wouldn't you agree that it is fabulous?

(Yo honestly, if your man Steve really talks like that... uh, that's not really normal...
Yeah, that sucks... Yeah, it's pretty bad...
Nobody's voice should sound like that.)

It was a lazy day, it was amazing grace
It was a half-a-dozen claymores daisy-chained
It wasn't daisies and crazy
Eights, it was an ace of spades over a waiting game of slaves
And saints, and every trainee face-painted while his great
Escape grazed and ate
He'll never make it, when he aims he shakes
And I was overly engrossed from a very locked door
With a couple milk duds and buckets of popcorn
(Pass the popcorn) Clap clap, encore, monkey in the middle study
How the bunker took the missiles, age of machines with nary a green
Screen, so the hecatomb is every bit as cutty as it seems
I could tell the pet from the vet, money where his canine's spread
And never welched on a bet, that said, know the over-under
On your local hunter and you'll profit off his widow-maker's
Numbers every summer, bump in the night, funny, will he catch and release 'em?
Has he mercy, will he hack 'em to pieces?
Is he dirty, will he hassle policeman and security breach until impurities leak over the circuitry?
And nada milk and honey there is only skulls and bunnies
That hop around drunk in the land of a hundred Mondays
God damn, pop the redenbacher proper and
For Christ's sake get this man a doctor!

Six in the morning and the walls close in
High noon calls and the walls own him
Kings at the ready know the walls won't win

Storms on the harbor like a harbinger of gore (Right)
Gore is my harbinger, pardon The Art of War (Right)
Get your doors darkened
By the house of card carpenters
Who never thought a slave could be a Spartacus and more
Pencil sharpener with a resume for the carnivores
Who take important conference calls in corner office walls
Still, a buck is a buck and he punch numbers
Five - punch
Just say no to company functions
And he duck into the dungeons
Nothing says "Kill it" like a day of fetching
Paper clips and staplers for the privileged
Two lives, one is chores for whores
One is where I wanna be when you begin regretting yours
And I poured in with a large coffee
Tardy every morning
To a man who took authority beyond what it was for
How you gonna pay the rent day-job-free?
Make rap records, matter of fact, thanks, peace

Six in the morning and the walls close in
High noon calls and the walls own him
Kings at the ready know the walls won't win

"I-I-I'm leavin'"

"You ain't shit man, your story's a joke
You should package it with a last smoke and six feet of rope."

Stay awake little misfit
Her lips wet a very particular mischief
Sis' wiggle an index, if your limbs let
Or settle for a warm, burgundy bubble out of her beak instead

Hey, tequila to free the worm
Had his liver scuba suit up on the Sabbath
His personal pale rabbit
At the hole's end her delicate mitten tipped
For sticking pissy liquor in him every day at six
Silly, predictability is a bitch
Fully patterned, had her awkwardly christening the small talk chalk board
She said, "This is less of a fixer-upper than my last bar."
"Funny, you're less of a fixer-upper than my last whore."
Crass is Similac to the milky wit of today's youths
Both chuckle out
Next couple on the house
Next couple on the couch
Swapping social coma rants
Phobias and soldier doubts, jokes and corporate mogul bans
Motor-mouths
The key to open his closure:
Pussy plus yay; she hid in a broken toaster
And later wake neighbors over chemical flavor to fuck sickly
Tooth, nail beauty through the skin deep

An object at rest tends to remain at rest
And an object in motion tends to remain in motion
With the same speed... slow down
With the same speed... slow down
With the same speed... slow down
And in the same direction
Down... down... down...

Now the dizziness is similar to whimsy with a pretty twist
If pretty is a bidding war for meteors of iffy sniff
And cigarettes, and pills on a speaker
Silhouetted by the muted television and the rickety Venetians
Between tweaks, he sweeps at home depot and reads
Mostly biblical, but not cause he believed
But found the lexicon of Jesus-heavy literature fly
Feverishly sponged up the information high
Fade into the cradle of his same deck train wreck
She pet him with a mechanical tape deck play back
Plus, the depressing sum of the two combined pay checks
Stung less when little Debbie D-cup put her legs back
Drunk, put her on the business-end of his favorite couplet from Corinthians
Sunk into the comforts of a kid again
Enough to share the stuff that truly interest him
This is where the vision of a shiny, happy Christmas end
Tipsy little princess wasn't listening, just yes-ing him
The more she fed him "yes", the more he fed her fresh barbiturates
Assuming it was them against the world into oblivion
But he was just a stupid simian that her live with him

An object at rest tends to remain at rest
And an object in motion tends to remain in motion
With the same speed... slow down
With the same speed... slow down
With the same speed... slow down
And in the same direction
Down... down... down...

Pirouetting madly on a mirror full of baggies
In the valley of the irritable Aggie
Any sincerity, miracles, or memory buried in the back-seat
By the hazardous materials was seriously gasping
Here he is in action trying to patch up the attraction
Figured he would win her back if he act in a common passion
Penned a couple chapters 'bout a sassy pair of magnets
With a cottage on a hill and a picket fence and a marriage
Never having gathered her rabid enthusiasm over language
Was fashioned around the aspirin in his cabinets
Asked her to read it expecting flattery after the fact
This is an exact imitation of how she react:
"You ain't shit man, your story's a joke
You should package it with a last smoke and six feet of rope."
Man she knows five chores, more coke, and all fours
Said, "Leave me on the floor and leave the dope by the door."
Bounced all shook up, she cook up aluminum
Consuming every skull and crossbones in the room
In under two minutes, he fuming with a flipped lid, stormed into the crib
And found her body on the tiles like, "No she didn't!", yes she did

Stay awake little misfit
Her lips wet a very particular mischief
Sis' wiggle an index, if your limbs let
Or settle for a warm burgundy bubble out of her beak instead

An object at rest tends to remain at rest
And an object in motion tends to remain in motion
With the same speed... slow down
With the same speed... slow down
With the same speed... slow down
And in the same direction
Down... down... down...

Take-take the medicine, tastes great
Got the key to the city, I’m wake-baked
Way before the media shitting or 12 zip of ganked paint
The origin of a thievery leader will take place
Two coke bottles adorn the rogue toddler
Grapple a refrigerator, gaffle a Nilla Wafer
And no role model provoke him to shift focus
Cause he noticed that a cookie tastes better when it's stolen
Kids got the darnedest quirks
So 11's arms skip jars for his momma's purse
And bought enough fireworks from the bullies to blow up a small barn
Which he kept in a box in the yard
And the bark isn't carved from a klepto-anthem
But a klepto-tangent prefaced the grand canvas
Dance to the dirge, stand up
Celebrate the natural need to own what ain't earned
See it rolls off the tongue
Like a smoke ring rolls off a lung 'til it's done
Ready, set, kept petty theft on a post-it
Later apply the motives to a moment on some grown shit
"Hey, you with the sharpie and BM!"
Did you foreplay the GM, or you carpe the diem?
Whore play the porn game, fornicate the sure way to freedom
Or correlate with the swordplay and heathens?
Trickery and backtalk, fresh outta high school
On the prickly catwalk of the modern grind slide rule
Every last number in its history
Got is own little hustle to nuzzle up with the victory
Thanks, bathe in a bottle of your finest
Tackleberry sift through the piss looking for diamonds
Before the hell appears to put the chemi in the climate
Get your money from the richest, get your pussy from the flyest

Slow and low, do or die calm, suicide king in the tuck of the palm
Slow and low, do or die stuck, two to five cans in the tuck of the trunk
And these are the five fingers that are stealing from you
And these are the five fingers that are stealing from you
And these are the five fingers that are stealing from you...
(Capture the flag)
(Capture the flag)
(Capture the flag)

One by one like little confused penguins
Larceny's yes-men ooze for used weapons
Like a bitter little burglar jaded up out the bucket seat
Is dumb enough to feel like the public owe him a fucking thing
Nope, gotta configure the five finger
So the hot-wired vehicular skill is applicable
If an eye's on the prize and the itch ain't flushed
I hope the fruits of your labor outlive the initial rush, like
Step on the abysmal cusp
With matchmakers trying to make the mixed signals fuck
Then incubate the mutt baby through his stigma's crutch
Like he will learn to walk after he lifts the drums
And this is certified milk by the New York Department of Skullduggery
Shoplift quicker than your shutter speed, click!
Missed, he dipped with dumb cutlery
In and out of muddy river water 'til the rudder bleed
Skip around the money pillar, color me bunny killer
Hovering where the mother feed, gutter greed king
And a crummy motherfucker breed fuck with me
It go knock knock rummy at a bruckner speed
The seed's all growns up playing grown people games
Evil aims grown, encompass the whole steeple chase
Grip, mitigate the master plan
So when the workers are asleep, riffraff expands
Yes a pig is a cop, but gotta fill up the flock
So when I rake in the bacon I hope the kiddies'll watch
I hope the flipping of the system will be heavily clocked
Cause opportunity's fickle, after it trickle it stop
Capture the flag, drag that crass little bastard
Flat through the hazmat and glass
Laugh when he ask for it back; scratch that:
Welcome to the magic in a basket of cash

Slow and low, do or die calm, suicide king in the tuck of the palm
Slow and low, do or die stuck, two to five cans in the tuck of the trunk
And these are the five fingers that are stealing from you
And these are the five fingers that are stealing from you
And these are the five fingers that are stealing from you...

Limped up like a dog with three legs (shut-up) to the stage...
So many dark arts to choose
You can focus to the phobias involved in forty hues
Whether you levitate or bend spoons
Tune into the prudence of the
Dark Heart News

A system of gods
From each of the brawling tribes
So my bible is a pot of qualms, clipped and collaged
Pavlov's bad dogs parry mass bells
I don't speak the language but my last laughs held

Okay the rotary corner
Grow to be notably mobile
And social gopher teeth form holes
Or any scene where Brie is normal
We'll locate every exit, had seconds to flee the wormhole
When emergency diversions ring the celly or the door bell

'ey, four corners of the globe All invent fire on the very same day in the very same cold
Each sent a man with torch to the border line to boast
Watch them collide and explode

What plague?
Make an idolant brigade
So eager to walk planks
They will climb a tree and wait
Their irony is waning over piety and faith
So when the ghostly ruminations come
We'll kindly disobey it
I will live to be a thousand with the patience of a saint
To see the hoi polloi becoming restless in their tanks
Can't hold howls in corrals with a key
So will the worms please shriek on the count of three
(THREE!)

Sideways eye on a sinister boundary
Panel of contemporaries killing me loudly
99 models of fear on the wall timorous
Done running into to the car on the wrong cinder blocks

Extra, extra, read all about me
At the bottom of our news tonight

We don't need no walkie-talkies, nope no walkie talkies
We don't need your coughing when offing the morning coffee
No, we don't need no walkie-talkies, nope no walkie-talkies
We just want our hermitry to stay and our coffee to go

And the last shall be
First to immerse in the pass out heat
Face in the mud where the moxie melt
'Till he woke up drowning in tchotchke hell
More in a cave with a torch on the wall
Than a window arrangement of porcelain dolls
On a brand new day, saw what he saw
Property owners who crawl to the mall
With a bad toupee and a face like he author the law
Pace like he mourning a loss
Right hand on a can of worms
Left full of gold he will trade for turf, I mean
That's ok, you got to answer to you at the end of the volatile day
But a model of mercy and might, no way
Marionette who will clap and obey
Dude, look, all that noise
Call that flight of the water boys
Meet and greet and they all slap five
Cheek to cheek when they colonize
And a grown-ass man shall abide as he wish
Walk that path with a dime and a stick
Walk that path with a diamond and wine
Walk that path to the firing line
Just walk, pay no mind
To the new recruit with the play-doh spine
Let's be friends from opposite ends
Wave to the kid don't hop on the fence
Play to the radius far and away
Orbit wide don't park in his space
One little martyr who talk in his face
Make one little Weathermen sharpen the blades

And the last shall be
First to the curb with the mad cow meat
Face in the bars of a regular cell
When he woke up high in collectible hell
Boom town kid who was taught by the binge
That a man who expire with the most shit win
That's warpy american nonsense penned by the rich
Not a routine friend in a pinch
Still not used to the stench
How it throws off otherwise lucid events
In the case the afraid observe
I got a Pro-Keds box full of layman's terms, it goes
Hey, peace, pray for the plagued
Major relief and capacious rains
But just cuz I don't want to war with you
It don't mean go warm up the barbecue
I'm like pardon you, sawed off limit
My high noon is a quick little minute
I don't wanna spend it sitting with a critic
Who simply isn't going to ever really get it
This HQ is alive and alone
No driveway no sign of a home
No dial tone, no line for the phone
No world's tiniest violin song
And I might just lie to them all, lie in the morgue
With a deep breath hiding and bored
Fighting a smile, highly annoyed
When the timing is right I will rise and record
Call for the monster beats and Blockhead got
Animal drums like he's doctor teeth
It goes red light green light 1 2 3
One large coffee, fuck you, peace

T-A-K-E-N-O-P-R-I-S-O-N-E-R-S

I stood before the glittery borders of new radius
In search of the fabled city of mud and crushed velvet
What I found was a gutter where the love of entertainment
Meets the lust for blood and demerits

Cutters of the pie throw your summers in the sky
Collar-pop Jolly Roger die motherfucker die
Apache on a ship shape, in Bristol fashion
Snuck a jammy through the red tape and tiptoed past him
Worm teeth grinding feverishly below
As little organic hacksaws eager to feed and grow
So when it's Blackhawk over the glass walk
They surface up through the cash crops
With clippers for your belly-up mascots and never dine alone
Meanwhile, back at sea level, it was home by home zone for zone
Bloom County's homeless riot for home ownership
I hope you put gas in the motor-home and know the roads
I studied with the finest combs stuck under my thumb
As opposed to the loaded nose who pray Armageddon is numb
And that's unevenly rendered
To those who grew up thinking faith was a surrender of reason
But not a reason to surrender
Catch the Liberty Fire's catalog
Forty torched orchids and citronella for Algernon
Don and Vagabond alike repent
This shit should have been Beta burns Babylon, the end

And when the radio stars climbed up out of the floors
To murder the medium that shot 'em thirty years before
They said
Kill television
Kill television
Kill television
Difficult isn't it
And when the cutters of the pie throw their summers in the sky
No love lost baby, the future is so bright
Kill television
Kill television
Kill television
Difficult isn't it

Nothing says charm like an armored car
Taking the clone-farm 'tards to the arms bazaar
We were the homemade marker makers born to pour the marsh ink into right guard parts
And march through the gauntlet of car alarms
No harps, no delusions of losing with something prettier
Than ash around the metacarpal still clutching the teddy bears
But we can run with scissors through the city fair
Or situate the nuzzle with the subtle art of splitting hairs
Double park the shuttle, some will arc the funneled cutty sark
Where budding narcs target the gushing heart in the muddy Clarks
These are the vices of the p-noid bastards
Who will chew whatever tablets blur the axioms fastest
But crews lose lunches by the hundreds
Lose electricity, lose gas, phone, plumbing
Humming keep your mouth closed
Keep your cows cloned, go
I am the pulse of this fucking town homes know
My what a convenient embargo
At least I'll always know which side of the gun I'm supposed to buy the farm from
The too-far-gone kicks, still in the box
Fix, still in the pill in his sock
Chilling, gill in the slop and a million watch Gideon scribes
But once the arc honor pussy and bribes, the animals will divide
And that's a win for the garish who keep charity in the parish
While profiting off the lack of a marriage amongst the classes

The mobile infantry is so postal
Coast into the quotient provoking the local Pistol Pete
Choking his liberty and justice quotas and cloaking his folk in smithereens
Smokey little pile of bloody pulp and co-dependencies
Dopey, no surrender, bender in effect
Sole defenders of the longest night New York had never slept
And there were jumping jacks and whistlers over Christmas
Like Rockets From The Crypt spilling the festive morning beverage of your preference
I step in Hog Heaven, stony, with no weapons
Pissing on teleprompters, selling megaphones to hecklers
Who broadcast eighty million versions of the sermon
For that one indisputable masterpiece before the curtains
Pale, Arcadian moon, high-definition, flat plasma
IMAX, city-wide transfer
Artificial Einstein-Rosen out the tenement
Ease into the Xanadu, let it hammer the tension out
I'm talking cool, calm, dominant phenomenal
Monitor face to the wall opposite
U.F.O.'s and locusts sing the same old song
While the Weathermen get retarded as the day is long

I was a dark, dumb student, no hooky rookie
Day tripping on visions of chickens that look like R. Crumb drew em
They grew em in a royal dirt of Suffolk County's
Flooring with the blood of an alcoholic clergyman in his forearms
Long Island was porn stars and puppies pushing sniffles
Fit into the aforementioned or slipped through the pinholes
Zook slipped through the pinholes
Crispy the God sender
Who thunk over a quarter plunk to local Mortal Kom vender
Both the formal squad censor, look down
Either side across the marsh before it was awesome cars
My calling card cavalry cooking an '85 Dodge Ares
Gas for Huntington and back barely
Equipped with Super-Soakers full of piss
And an uncanny knack for constantly upsetting pigs by doing stupid shit
The kid piloted his ring king dummies to King Kullen
Where he hollered fuck the world from a parking lot in the suburbs
What's this
A couple spray cans and a little litter
But they'd look at us like swindlers with them Ricky Kasso jitters
So fuck em, a glutton sunk into the alley for props
But things will still go bump when them halogens pop
Believe I'll be there when it happens
The shaking of the plates off the mantle
The snaking of the flames off the candle
The lady of the lake off the answers
Admitting the mistakes to their deplaning cadavers
Now it's rest in peace Will Peterson whose heater sung disturbingly to
Further re-evaluate your beast of burden's urgency
Damn doggy, good times, thanks
I wrote your name in wet cement by the Brooklyn Banks
What's this

I'm an activator
Made a fire, made a wheel, made a snack for later
Catacomb kids cuddle up and test the flavor
When the towns speed freaks sleep
Trap the traitor, he will ask for papers
What's this
Say I'm an activator
Made a roof, made a weapon, made a flag per acre
By the snotty little muzzle of a latch-key neighbor
When the folk push aggie over some dap with gators
He will catch the vapors

Couple Playboy mudflaps and hell on his heels
Beautifully echoed in the pace at which he shovel his meals
Like not a farmer among us had a harvest survive the winter
So dinner split a lima bean in triplets, pick a winner
Took a couple summers puking pills behind the dumpster
As the largest Pez dispenser on record recouped his numbers
One shoe in the soupy gutter
One shoe in the velvet heaven
Where the mermaids told him shake em by the lake of melted weapons
What's this
You could dance purty with the hooligan nation
Who will be patiently awaiting zoo-keeper facelift
Extra the days of yore painted similar uber-ape shit
We've merely updated the ancient 8-bit
Yeah I'm dumber than a cow on a roof in a flood
Who's not as dumb as the watered-down beef from the burgers that jumped
I'm dumber than a Taz on a beach chair with a martini
Who's not as dumb as the tat wit the same scenery
What's this
Sparky nails pig stigmata for all good sport
Garbage pail kids unite at the mall food court
They chase cheese fries with Binaca
They had shut the school down early
There were bombs inside the lockers
No concept of the problem
We responded like a snow day
It was clobber shit to flotsam
Til the cops said it was okay
Okay show the squadrons back into their boxes
Like his Breakfast Club of hotheads show no progress to the doctors
And I walk into the office, coughing awful ether often
Flood a parking meter fever, knuckle up for Love and Rockets
It was reign of the razor laser
Day of the cloudy howdy
Flight of the shelter melter
You can bow without me
What's this

Watch me jump
What's this
Knock em out the box, Aes

This is my friend Tony
He's pretty cool, although he's not always so smart

And then they were eight
Just like that, just like that...
(Bring back Pluto, back-back Pluto)

In the beginning it was Large Marge sent me, I'm bent
Empty the rent if you can double park the garbage barge gently
The moon took a second mortgage on the seventh house
And Jupiter ain't talk to Mars, he felt the host of rovers sold him out
Close your mouth, poke your snout over the cloaked aroma clouds
Solar boy elope with couch ogling older Polaroids
Motor mouth, chauffeur the golden molar toy
Gophers yoke a fish out of water, he grows lungs and multiplies
Idle when soldering a perfect union
It is vital to calculate any ornery loose ends
So if mutiny ensues the aloof is assumed nuisance
The clue is in his vacancy, the proof is in his goosebumps
Maroon the traitors expecting acres of edelweiss
Who later learn it may actually be safer to play with knives
I show up late looking project grizzly
Two bowies, a third for throwing and accomplish dickweed
Nothing, nada, nill, I stuff a lot of pill to gut
What's the proper rules on stuffing hostages in trucks?
I'll be numb enough to chill before the choppers spill the blood
But if I'm not!
Fuck it, plug him, warpy got his goddamned groove back
Jet-setting on spec with a dead yeti on the roof rack
And miscreants will rubberneck jalopy euthanasia
Which will later be regretted when it's your turn for cremation
And I walk like early man, freak a little witch hunt
Gathering the carnies and exploiting every stigma
The malformed oddities among sovereignty's normal
Shall abuse every vice you can imagine right before you

All I thought of was the cloven-hooved
And how they clip-clip-clop over the woven roofs
With a nose for commotion and stolen goods
Now tell me, what the fuck am I supposed to do?
In the mean time (nine) minus (one) left (eight)
In the mean time (nine) minus (one) left (eight)
In the mean time (nine) minus (one) left (eight)
We were busy putting barbs on a large iron gate

(Mercury, Venus, Earth, Mars, Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, Neptune)
(Bring back Pluto, back-back Pluto)
(Back-back Pluto, Plu-Plu-Pluto)
They're all-they're gonna want his milk money next

Stare into the glowing eye of Cerberus and crow
Authoritative laminates will not repel the quarantined alone
All the town sickly know the Coke machine as home
Where they sit and hope the Ovaltine that noble's drink is strong
Couples only roller rink with soul to kiss your chicken noodle
Before they wiggle mittens through the pillory to ridicule
And you can hear the iron maidens lock
Or see the town criers ankle stock chained up to the tanker truck
A is up early, ring and run thank you much
Document a little of that underbelly bang for buck
Hey I walk as the hype of the city gossip
Meaning every dumpster diver's gotta vomit up a comment like
Um you ain't shit, this ain't ill
This is little Russian dolls that get smaller and smaller still
This a corpse full of pills trying to sit still and build
Cause eight planets bullied number nine until he fell
Babylon goggles, gawk for the galvatron coppers
Tugboat salvage all fossils
I'll be shepherd when the whirlybirds deny the lepers doctors
If I'm not, fuck it
The terrible metal hacking seasons's as American as ski up off a plastic d-cup
You'd think Charlie Brown was Weathermen
How I zig-zag around these yellow backs for peanuts
In the baggy stomach lining attached to the bums in hiding sits the morals
Every outing would slide to refine his grinding
When the freakishly disfigured have been triggered to surround you
You will live inside the actual second they let the hounds loose

Checkmate sucka, not a move, game's over!

Who's that walking with a hole in his head?
Big bad Bazooka Tooth, I came to break bread
What's a troop's recipe for treacherous times?
I tell 'em... ah, fuck it, yo!

I pull the elephant tranq out of my neck
Gaffle a tank, count up the chips, wrastle the fangs off of my fist
Flood a little soldier blood over the ogre acres
On some holiday in Cambodia with motor-home appraisers
Pagans fade into the Kodachrome - now, later
With a lid to brow staple
Revisit the cobra loading zone
Molar foaming, but he hold his own wound
Cauterized, by the Zippo he had stole that afternoon
And my dog tags jingle by the monster island heart he built
Grew up with a jughead crown tilt and tardy slip
Be all you can be just never soothed us (Nope!)
You lost me in that part about scrubbing piss with a toothbrush
Holler scum's lullaby
Live from the ultra-fly, sham city bunker
Where the coldest cults multiply alarmingly
Hush little baby, timeout!
The black market mockingbirds can not sing a lick
But learn to peck your eyes out
Of commission with love, out a tradition of wraiths
Pick on the visions that buzz, bet on the kitten's escape
Solder the piston to pump - out a veteran amplifier
And magnify through the same lens that set the ants on fire
Flush the moppet hootenanny
Who could fancy, honor circuit when the circle's every duke is clammy?
Trooper, scoop the food in pantry
Ante up, stupid!
May delusion feed em foofi candy
And pry the gold out of his tooth when lamping
Pocket all you can now
Block will lead the lambs down
To the cold cutlery outfit, slaughter beef and cow tip
Pour the chief some fountain soda, motor prone to pen the holy opus
And pry this monkey off the Scoliosis like

Who's that walking with a hole in his head?
Bazooka Tooth, gemini, I came to break bread
What's a troop's recipe for treacherous times?
I tell 'em fast cars, danger, fire and knives, let's go
Fast cars, danger, fire and knives
Fast cars, danger, fire and knives
Fast cars, danger, fire and knives
I got her majesty Athena riding shotty wide-eyed

It's like never mind the bullocks
Fuck, like every other week these hipster tabloids
Jumping on and off my Sex Pistol's bullets
Like every other week he spins the bottle
Like every other week these fucking fanzines forget if they spit or swallow
Too bad your inner sheep never forgets to follow
Cause my inner greed to feed your hate for loving us is hostile
Fortunate for me, it coincides with what comes natural
So the mongrels that I run with turn the "fuck you's" into fast food
Like a little freak sick of the 3 o'clock bully knuckle dust
Nursing his last shiner, finds the shoebox in his mother's truck (uh-oh)
Tomorrow's extra curricular punching bag
Will finger daddy's widow maker out a brown lunch bag (bang)
This is where the hunch back snake oil peddlers
Stuck under the burgundy sky of spaghetti westerns
Tend to bubble up, weathermen huddle up
Today, the son of one too many "yes sir's"
Kings his checkers, watch the double jump
Back with a platter of hot leeches that'll drink up-every bloody drop down
To the last diseases, it's A-E-S-O-P-R-O-C-K, the peak twister
Defender of the son of Vaughn Bode's Cheech Wizard
I used to pray the treatments got easier with my aging
Like Serotonin weekends was merely comedic hazing
Wrong, but along his travels located the key to world peace:
Kill every motherfucker but me
You cool with that? Cool, bang
You? Cool, hang
You? No? Uh..bang? Cool
Sorry, dog, rules is rules
And too long have I followed yours
I'm trying to get them years back
And walk through every Cypher with dynamite in a beer hat

Who's that walking with a hole in his head?
Bazooka Tooth Krueger, I came to break bread
What's a troop's recipe for treacherous times?
I tell 'em fast cars, danger, fire and knives, let's go
Fast cars, danger, fire and knives
Fast cars, danger, fire and knives
Fast cars, danger, fire and knives

Deliver us from evil
Litter bugged amoeba simmer on the brimstone
Grim tone, bring him home
Authoritative restoration will be rationed righteously
To those deemed suitably fit to police their own sobriety
Standard law that wriggle intimate, mingle with coincidental mishap, then snap
Curse the digs
Yellow brick Zooka birthed the piss
I trust that every litigant will be his own worst pig
Thirst big, baby, I reckon y'all are a mess too, but insecurities will
Make your bio sound less cool
If fizzy lifting drinks are par for saddling your horse
You might consider sawing Sea Biscuit off at the knees before
Few chew sacred like them sewer cougars
Patient 'til the Lugar movers daytrip with them super cookers blazing
Divvy up the remarkable carcass, what a relief
And y'all ain't even washed yesterday's blood off your teeth
Behind the buck-bin Duane Reade aviators plated with the dookie brown tint sit
The googly off the daily paper
Clip red or blue (Blue!)
Either way the shredder chew
Letter to the editor messenger, let him through

Engine engine number nine, sock it to me one more time
Said uh, un-gowa, we got the power (Repeat 3x)
Automatic systematic engine number nine, sock it to me one more time
Said un-gowa we got the power
Okay, do your thing (*Echoes*)
Family, do your thing, do your thing, stop

I put a beetle on his back and take notes
Play a dealt hand. Kicks wing tips 'til the tank flips conveyor belt
Shelf a mayor saber for catering navy savior
Help who treat stray children like clay pigeons off the sailor's deck
He squeaks 'pull', I freak the wool over the owl eye;
Filter sheepish winter through its sister on the outside
Meanwhile back at HQ, he's twisting his moustache, hatching a plan to hate you
Shark fin dollar pay a ghost guild buckets
Hard pill to swallow and he knows pills, trust him
Drunkards of the crystal palace suck assignment
Walk the diamonds in the soles of your chukkas back to the slaves who mined 'em
It's Raggedy Andy clan; fancy the pretty stitches
'til he learned the skinny on the fragility's physics
Like he snag a button eye on the fly by the barbs
Super glue the parts, now his students are alarmed
No worries, it's snow flurries compared to what the sheriff wish:
Curfew the city that must not
Bust warn shots at a run-of-mill Waldo on a doctor hunt
He will make the most wonderful sarcophagus occupant

Engine engine number nine, sock it to me one more time
Said uh, un-gowa, we got the power (Repeat 3x)
Automatic systematic engine number nine, sock it to me one more time
Said un-gowa we got the power
Okay, do your thing (*Echoes*)
Family, do your thing, do your thing, stop

Rotten egg, not to be pegged as fashionably tardy
The difference is the latter got the freebies from the barkeep
Wait, Aes-fucking-Rock is in the building
The room looked up, looked down, kept sniffing
Slit the neck and slip the chip in, sipping anti-governmental zombie grog
But zombied up gladly on your Swiss Army watch
As if twitching upon your authored condition's
Really that different from administered conditioning glitches
Kissing a firewater pitcher with the fatal Drano-chase game
It's hiding in the Nang labeled with the day-glow face paint
Some buckle when the T-Rex treks shakes the puddles
My huggable jungle
My son of a dove cry, humble, even doves die
I took the black outta something to judge the lung by
I took the mag out like the crack out of a bum's pipe
I hook the tag up like a flag over the plum sky
Mud pie cruiser with an oink for the innocent
I blame it on the ambiguous quote unquote system
If a quota needs some filling you're a whore
Sincerely yours, engine number nine conductor
All aboard!!

Engine engine number nine, sock it to me one more time
Said uh, un-gowa, we got the power (Repeat 3x)
Automatic systematic engine number nine, sock it to me one more time
Said un-gowa we got the power
Okay, do your thing
Family, do your thing, do your thing, stop

March
The more the merrier
Get a couple or more to carry you to the burial
F-R-E-S-H
Fresh to death and keep it def to the left
Well it was Capricorn, Virgo, Aquarius
(Check!), Cancer, Leo, Sagittarius
(Check!), Pisces, Libra, Scorpio, Aries, Gemini, Taurus
Let 'em die for it

Delicate freak show alert the frame
Bash all flags where the mag spin park
Corroded by the volts that jolt the cold vein
Boogie down kits to slip past the guard
Def with a mascot of radical mass
Megaphone fuzz and a woofer on fritz
We are not trained to divert the crash
But march face first with a prayer for the blitz
Stand up for the cinema fire, simian ire
Cold shimmy for the cinnamon sky;
Intimate eyes loop all known alleys
Scoop the bounty like daddy hires Bazooka to murder Ralphie
I curdle with burnt milk, pariah sigh, honor piranha money
Count it with the knuckle that hustle bread out a copper-tummy
One of these rebels could level the marked city
But the N.Y. uber alles governor's picky
I'll be the jenky Jesus for the species you bleed with
Ultra, soldier poach the folklore
Jump guns through the ninth gate
Jump guns like a noon six burner lit up on the ninth pace
Even set among a portion conformed to the blind stage
Never lured by the formal watching imported wines age
We bow to the gusto mustered by the mecha-bot
Plowed by the public, ushered out the letterbox
Wowed by the subject punctured by the helicop
Boy meets vermin: the widescreen version
Headaches, nausea, vomiting, facial paralysis
These are a few of my favorite venomous side effects
Mamba, Water Moc, Pit Viper, Diamond Back
Anaconda, Boomslang, Cobra, bite 'em back
Spinal tap crabs to the clapper
Aesop Rock is the Cadillac of natural disaster
Push that button
Everybody gotta push something
That's why the envelope is where it wasn't
I work with the builders, whittle my gorilla military
And fizzle 'em through the vigilante filters
Who lamps left of the toggle?
How'd they fit that ninja in a bottle?
Done a hundred million motherfuckers with they hands out
Versus a walking zipper bomb trying to keep the man down

Get up (get down)
Sit up (sit down)
It's either fancy footwork (or get bit by the hounds)
Face up (face down)
Laced up (laced down)
It's either fist to the sky (or get bit by the crowd)
Well it was Capricorn, Virgo, Aquarius
(Check!), Cancer, Leo, Sagittarius
(Check!), Pisces, Libra, Scorpio, Aries, Gemini, Taurus
Let 'em die for it

I was chewing my tongue out of my mouth one day
When the blood in my beard hit the dirt by the blazers
Would have said 'curb it' like any nervous habit
'til maverick told me the coyote pack could smell the wound for acres
And labor to cater fang to fisherman gut critters
Oblivious to the glimmer of innocent duck feathers
Fuck it
Want a carnivore war? Bet
I'll be at the Bronx Zoo with a lock pick kit
On the eject for cockpit bench, helicop clip
Nazi cops on kamikaze belly flop shit
Roger, hop-fence-kill-a-crop, monster
We are the tired and poor, we come for your water
Boom!
Bounce when the church corrupt
When the mayor knuckle dust city worker bugs
When the stars finger babies like I flirt with sluts
You'll see the fire engine red fox ears perk up
Metal kettle unsettling treble howl, settler trembling
Measuring mellow on the levitate off the mezzanine
Never seen a ton of bricks dressing clean dapper
'til it's pin stripe and skull chunk forty stories after
And U.S.A. on a Ketamine disaster
Cane for stress
Crack if the former left you unimpressed
Now pardon me if part of me heart of an oddball, but damn
Kumba-fucking-ya, dog
Terminally alienated and bent awkward by the bought
Prepped package of the slickest spin-doctors
Raised where the paranoid hide tools proper
Like suspicious cargo in a high school locker
And it looks like war, quacks like war
So it's Occam's Razor and I'm swayze out the door
A hundred million motherfuckers hold me back
The hand cannons won't ask 'bout your zodiac, boy

Get up (get down)
Sit up (sit down)
It's either fancy footwork (or get bit by the hounds)
Face up (face down)
Laced up (laced down)
It's either fist to the sky (or get bit by the crowd)
Well it was Capricorn, Virgo, Aquarius
(Check!), Cancer, Leo, Sagittarius
(Check!), Pisces, Libra, Scorpio, Aries, Gemini, Taurus
Let 'em die for it

They were selfish with the helmets on the little bus
'Till brake fluid sewage crippled up the get-retorted nickel punks
Slowly cope but swore his lowly robot vole evoke
Would one day rise in sections to interrogate the Holy Ghost
[I knew it!]

Holy smokes!
Father, black suit white collar
Kiddie porn dungeon, guns, and three fingers for your daughter's
Caught belly-up, antique Nazi paraphernalia
You cannot pay your bills with holy water and Hail Mary luck [Oh my!]
Shucks fucker, enjoy the Alcatraz shower fun
And mommy's mad I'm cliche generation X agnostic front
It ain't the nifty fate, the 1958, before the New-New Testament-approved Altar-boy fisting rape
And "take me to your leader"
Long as he don't manipulate toddler beaver [Leave him alone!]
Call me crazy, but I bet that wasn't God's demeanor
Sodom-meter peaking [Me too!]
But Long Island was Jesus every weekend
Spoon-fed to appease traditional love bringing
Of a Middle Pennsylvania shit-hole where elders movement
Stressed the stellar therapeutic Bible cycle (How?)
One church with a bait and tackle store next door and not much MORE
So the two moved to New York, made babies raised on what they SAW
Christmas morning smelled fresher than angel pussy
But immaculate conception came second to playful goodies
Like laser-tag was way more spiritual than blood and body wafer bags
And manger staff as long as Santa ate the cookies [Well...]
Grandma was a saint, while he'd paint with snakes and bullies
Said If only you'd memorized your prayers like you did your Kool Gs!
By the time I was old enough to know what religion was
I was Catholicism-numb and truly didn't give a [FUCK!]
'94: Moved out the crib and it ain't seen a steeple since
What Knievel-evil seeps in a Christian leader's pitch
'Till priests' laps slapped with parental advisory warnings
I'll be auditioning Gods in my office on Monday morning

Uh oh! And yet another pill slipped
Down the hatch and pass 'em through the kill-switch

I need a couple A's for Q's
I'm not an asshole I'm just a little confused

Just a little bruise in the back of the pews
Acting amused with a mask and them Vatican blues
For in the eyes of the organization I was raised in
Aes' is just another cynic-brick in Hell's basement
Cubicle adjacent to the killers and rapists
For what? Drugs and fucking, It's part of growing up
Like cuffs over dumb shits is better than the schools
I'm not an asshole I'm just a little confused
Just a lit fuse in the back of the pews
Watching a thousand flavors of the same God feud
I figure ultimate-peace is the common theme
So its a no-brainer "peace" when the blood hit the screen
Got a basic good and evil sensibility born
Good neighbor know a halo when it's fit over horns
I'm more science than faith, I'm more karma than bread and booze
I'm not an asshole I'm just a little confused
Not an asshole I'm just a little confused
Not an asshole I'm just a little confused
Not an asshole I'm just a little confused

(You know what? To be completely honest, Aesop, you're a fucking asshole)

Parachute ratty, one bunk cord now the air is scooped badly
Dripping out the sticks like a twig-tweed hammock
Miter cut the cables for that quick, clean transit
Miser took the big screen; Panic made a business card
Ankle out of whack, painkiller tobacco scrap
We navigate the yellow corn hype for the barn
When the spotlight swiveled hard right over the farm
Post up, 3 cheers for the gimp
Spread thank you (3 on the right)
Limp to the door, splint what he mangles (3 on the left)
Yea I knew the percentages
But the numbers were unaware of the grand finale's emphasis
And over the scent of a thousand dead dogs
Agent ?Zip-Zooka? swore to pull it off, GAMEFACE
Walkie-talkies squawking up his hip regarding paratroopers: 20 (Ha!)
Tug ??a noise/annoys?? box-trigger reporting for hunting

I have landed safely
I have not received my papers
I have zero natural enemies
I don't know my location
I have no training in reconnaissance, combat or colluding
I'm calling for my orders, over
(STRAP ON A HELMET AND START SHOOTING!)

Ride up on a killer horse, numb and bloodthirsty
'Till the uncle spitter beg the pig to hug mercy (Ha!)
240-below shit, kickers tickle the corpses (duck!)
Duck the widow-maker, also manufactures swords (ok...)
Manufactures ornaments, if it moves stick a fork in it
Winners take all, killers rape all coordinates
Unfortunately, courted by the most tenacious gaurdian
Whose aimless nature bait a harlequin taste the martyr's skin
No Semper Fi (Nope), no saluter units
Soldier the fire is more flesh than sulfer
And when the automatic-jitters wiggle the ribs
I feel so alive it don't matter which bitches litter is clipped (Bang!)
Sun down, goggle up; canteen gobble-juice
Teargas nozzle up, brain buff hostile youth
Chop it up, lock a noose upon it
You will die for the glory of...Shit, I can't put my finger on it
But it's big! Big and legitimate
Justify women and kiddie killer shit, iller it builds
So he is not a natural predator, but can dismantle an AK-47
Clean and rebuild before you can mayday bretheren (Mayday!)
Muddy-gut snake eyes, he approaches cobras with an ugly muck
And bloody Bowie knife clamped in the canines
Wake 'em with that blind military mechanism set to bludgeon
WHAT IS YOUR MAJOR MALFUNCTION!?

I have landed safely
I have not recieved my papers
I have zero natural enemies
I don't know my location
I have no training in reconnaissance, combat or colluding
I'm calling for my orders, over
(STRAP ON A HELMET AND START SHOOTING!)
I was standing at attention with a pocket full of weapons
And the will to walk a mile in the same fatigues that I slept in
I have yet to find a day in life worthy of my saluting
I'm calling for my orders, over
(STRAP ON A HELMET AND START SHOOTING!)

I shimmy up out of the fox-hole, disorderly
Only after having logged every cadaver accordingly
High scores keep our Tama-tongs enthralled
(There is no course iller than no course at all)
Okay, if his perspective is smirked, sneaky detective work is aborted
And it's no longer whisper-mode on the red alert
No bed of dirt 'n' sniper rifle peeking out the bunker (uh!)
Now I'm set in city looking for something to puncture (*gunshot*)
Help me up, the numbers of the heroes sat at suppers
Treat the public like a tin can, riddled before it plummets (Brrrap!)
But, adrenaline can lead to lazy-eye hassles
So he list the little boy 'n took the pin out the pineapple (Heh)
Thats funny...Bumps into the steel-toe
Thats lovely, sum it up in (Oh, hell no!)
And just as fast as the parachute cable snipped
I was rag-doll, horizontal, two limbs short of fixed
Link a baby pulled around the standard issued weaponry
While fading as a blemish in civility's memory
They will step over the body for the looting..
(Ready on the firing line)
(The fuck is that?)
STRAP ON A HELMET AND START SHOOTING!

Smack dab in the middle of the cuddles and kills
Guerilla jimmy city limits with a bucket of pills
Hollring 'no I don't immediately ameliorate 'em
I meet 'em, greet 'em, read 'em, and rate 'em, see if I hate 'em

You take a pitch black lung and a purple heart
Then you kick back once the inertia start
And when the shipwreck sunk through the perfect dark
The serpent's arch alerts every circled shark
See, bloody salt water sounds the h'ors d'oeuvres alarm
And when the first arm's found we observe the art
Like a belly-acher won't kick face to the curb
Rather kick when the face already raped by the worms

I was buried to the neck in them all-start bloopers
Periscope down, hop Boss Hog cruiser
Porcelain or pewter authority will be over ruled the second jukie uber alles news hit the sewers

Okay, lefty field..stealth
Dressed to kill..self
Megawatt meter horizontal neck spin
Swims bloody to vertical bobble-head yes-men

Don't picket the misfit law, Nancy
The core's no picnic. Mislead whores advancing
No business. Insist lured with candy
To cure citizen x with that all-rours dancing
Corporals landing
Ashore, all soar boned nitwit, rickety rackety porn fancy
Weave through the hell and high water hot zone
Diseases in the minute the idiot got home

Rickety Rackety
This city fit my style exactly
Near the fire ladder
Where the wires gather
Drink water, eat fish, smile after
Rickety rackety
Rickety rackety

Two shoes chewed up, colluded with the feuds, rogue, veterans
Food, clothes, medicine
Wheeled it out the smoke stack factory trained to capture in the zoo's ghost predators
Food, clothes, medicine
I think I thunk a bunk colony could possibly amuse grown delegates
Food, clothes, medicine
Peace, the whipper-snapper generation greet 'em with a full blown pistol pull
Food, clothes, medicinal
Variety, for every plastic orange bottle
The tarnished pharmacy labels chafed in abrasive pockets
Suit the hell hounds with blades and chain lengths
For the dead walk a little less clumsy than you think
Hunger pain, chump change tell it to how his belly get
When bourgie hopes hellions
Food, clothes, medicine, alumni
Bum, I got the skin on the teeth between my fingertips and stellar
Let's bet it melts together
Let's get these men some shelter
Three hots and a cot with Quaaludes
On a pillowcase left on an ultimately cordial gesture by the staff, (Staff)
It's a bath house for brave soldiers
When they coordinate to fornicating whores in maid's clothing
Sip a hot mocha, kick-up-chug up to the apple box
Frankie says, "Relax", 20 says he snaps, safe wager
Hell, 90 percent sensitive jubilee
Never returned to brag about that fish bigger than you and me
Walk on glass, cruise cloaked residents
Bang on doors, food, clothes, medicine
United we stand to all our parties click
I divide and conquer cause frankly I'd rather sit
We saw them rat races, machine or man, sprocket or fat laces
Hatchback of flashbacks from a heyday full of bad blazers
Now Major Aes route the following order
To all his crew's chromed generals
Food, clothes, medicine

Walk on glass, bang on doors
Talk all trash, hang on whores
Walk on cash, bank on wars
Like food, clothes, medicine, it's yours
It's yours, it's yours, it's yours

We rotate protocol on a ring finger neighbor to peruse gross negligence
Food, clothes, medicine
Martyrs leak faster if the carver tweaks the dagger, 90 moves choked citizens
Food, clothes, medicine
Well y'at's a quick example accept as commitment's castle, cool, dope, excellent
Food, clothes, medicine
It's tough to legislate when scum tongue down a dinner plate of booze, coke, heroin
I'll bite the hand that feeds
Chew the steak and spit the knuckles back
Stitch 'em up and give em dap, before his brother's rubberneck
Iron chef Lithuania christen kitchen stadium
With chicken and mass serotonin drifting into gravy-dom
Save me some, scallywags hold your breath
The curmudgeon's gun dusty like the road to death
Bag a pin stripe my lizard kisser no kill switch
Just a guilty gizzard wanna recommend a pill slip
I wipe placenta off my face in the height of the disco era
Cruise through liquid bubble gum, fever, death, and Christmas sweaters
Through juice saccharin fast food studied holdin' cliff's notes vendors
Now holds a bachelors in training ninjas to tip toe better
These are them sham city kidney kicks to the loose bolts
Belly ache-killins for claim who stand iffy on food, clothes, medicate
Pollywog, hug a spot lit with bigger lizards
In the land of hot milk and honey with stingers in it
Zinger!
Jimmy to jist up, check ya tip cup
Mother's watching babies near to preachers keen on fist fucks
Keep your schnoz clean, ears open, chopper zipped up!
Food, clothes, medicine, cause hungry, naked, sick, sucks!
Collide your worker ants, with autobahn inertia dance
And curb them herbie love bug by the cursive final curtain clamp
Another savior with his foot, cold, stuck in his mouth
I played that who knows, food, clothes, fuck it, I'm out

Blazin' with a facemelter
Go fish
Pigeon, itching for a pit to put the pig in
Scalped, bottom feeder, nose bleeder, cheap seats
To the meat eater sweeps sweet freak freaks
What up?
Grip clicker, smack the dummy box fix picture
Stickle over shit, cinema flicker in the plasma
The latch key degree was obtained in the savage years
Where he learned the binding of a wire hanger to rabbit ears
Every pixel that leaked dead over the carpet
Had to be spit shinned and hidden before the ford duster parketh
When mommy marched in, wrapped the broccoli in the napkin
For your electric paradisio after the parent crashes
And I'm high on ion jitters, call it a prime directive of the damned
Who grew to sleep easy to white noise
The humming of the machinery running towards them crawl
Social retardation larvey plugged into the wall
The little short circuit with the still born vibe
Till the villagers circled and determined "it is alive"
Shipped to Bellevue eyes fuzzy talking funny
Like "eagle one to grey squirrel whats your twenty dunny?"
I piss clumsy with electrode head pan (sorry)
Pitty the pretty internet gotta empty the bed pan
Left hand numb from the finger to the thumb (right!)
Right got tubes in it, irony is fun (yaaay!!)
At some point early when drunk on electric kisses
I'd apparently notarized forms excusing scalpel slippage (sign this)
The pain came on a makeshift main stage
And sentenced to in an inoperable eight bit frame rate
For that I made a game play, reborn torn
At the ministry of information trying to get informed
They'll duck it out and I will cease all wars
So if you babysit a caroline be fore warned
I be the ultimate (ultimate), multi polar
Mobile medicine cabinet stocked adequate
Pockets like maracas, that will shake when he stepped
Which explains the circle of rattlesnakes where he slept
Smarter then the average bear, barter parts and gadgets
With battery op enthusiast pardon the barking badgers
While you were parking daggers in kittens with snarling children
I was sharking classes with taggers for television (Click!)
Gattaca days, Attica paper scattered
Diagonal mahogany boggled the train savage
To boxed the botanically inclined child slave labor
Blades clipped the perfect petal now play later
Play never, if escaped raped treasure
That's a jewel freebie out a old geezer, no teether
Or even yesteryear scrapes fester, administer gauze
But cauterized wounds bleed if you ain't ethered the cause
King of applause (yay!) beats the garbage flood for ten
Porn king of New York, alley punk perv scum
Waddle on the voyage of the voyeur
Six four sick king breezer sniff whores through brick
I am so dangerous evil and mercy heaven
Allergy to compassion he is the perfect weapon
Un- earth it and siphoned from Delorean doors swivel up
With aviator radar blip for most glorious titty fuck
Cool green over the frame under the clothes line
Whose crew choose fuel most, mine
Holy trinity, triple six, triple x, city barrack
Glutton for punishment super size me while you at it
He da:
Built hideous,silk of the milk litigant, silly wicked finicky fidget the middle digit ish
Will he alter what he feel is illy to pick at every little smidgen of integrity
As your industry bitch? NO
Final answer, track the moniker
To the freight hot reaking of butter beans and harmonica
Dirty old man no tea cup thirst, peak up skirts
For slaps from that d-cup nurse
Cackle his old gums lewd (lewd), crass
Show the girl a trick like how he opens can food with the only tooth he has
She like THAT'S FUCKING DISGUSTING
They don't call him anabolic Aes for nothing, OK
Now current picture aside all anti-celebs remain aggro
Half mast the flag pole
Dead walk sturdy, but the day I greet the worms
I pull the daisies down with me as a fuck you to the norms
Generic's so unappealing and in my humble opinion
Defeats a rappers civic duty to the culture
Granted every topic has been covered but cookie cutter
Delivery of simpleton wit is the real culprit
So whether street, club, battle, conscious or other
I find that interesting style can often out weigh the subject
So when the disc changer goes from guns to space
It is not an attempt to fake credibility for the public
But fuck it it's ace rock six records of gibberish right?
He's trying too hard to be weird and different right? (riiiiight)
Or could it possibly just maybe be, his lessons
Can't be summed up in a linear set of pop culture references?
(WOW) yeah but why try, I'm so groggy
The mach nine Ballentine ain't for everybody
But I will say this to y'all that used your fifteen of fame
To mention my name, that sixteenth minute regret is fucking insane
And that's a longevity veteran peddling free medicine,(here)
Who the fouler howler (me) who the rabble rouser
What the happy hour starved the Peruvian aggy powder,(tight)
Trade up at the digital Jesus factory outlet (bout it, bout it)
Bout it bout it, fuck a fork tongue cutlery, the fuckery is famous
Never wild shook but a slang that maybe alienated a couple strangers
Held a mongoloid fanbase that is alien by nature
Robot wars, machines hit the floor
And the simians syncopated a gigantic "encore"
Alright I'm bored, five minute bag of tricks
If you hate me you can eat a bag of dicks

Postcards from the pink bath paint leisure
As a cloaked horse through a stained-glass Saint Peter
Hack faith-healer, cheat death to the very end
Cherry wooden nickels on his specs for the ferrymen
X-O, Zodiac a pentagram expo
Pet Cemetery in electric fresco
Abaddon threshold, flash forged in a galley
With undead orcs pulling oars through the algae
Smash cut to a smoke-bombed quarantine
Guards like, "All signs correlate with sorcery"
It's more a dormant cell of valor as awoken by the smell of sordid power
And defecting shortly after
Fist bump dry land, brackish
Cat nap 15, back to swiss-cheese the flagship, uh
Blue in the menacing grip of a day for which you're manifestly unfit

Final answer "not to be", "not to be" is right!
Next question - to build winged shoes or autophagy
Silk-screen band tees, take apart a VCR
Ringer off, canned peas, cabin fever mi amor
Patently adhering to the chandelier at key-in-door
To usher in the understated anarchy of leisureforce
Led a purple tongue and ratty Caballeros
Up over the black rainbow into the house of mirrors
To become a thousand zeroes, echoing a twisted alchemy
Freak flags, fluttering to circadian free jazz
Sleep apnea, scratching, "bring that beat back"
I doze off, clothes on, nose in the feedbag
Shhh... Om nom, nom, blinds drawn
Compost thrown to the spine pile, bygones
Mangy, intimately spaced pylons
On a plot of inhospitable terrain, "Hi mom!"

Midsummer, bit crusher, midwinter, bit shifter
Midsummer, bit crusher, midwinter, bit shifter
No sleep, gold mine, front door circled
Proceed, low light, 24 curfews

Midsummer, bit crusher, midwinter, bit shifter
Midsummer, bit crusher, midwinter, bit shifter
Crows beak, cold night, unmoored virtue
Proceed, snow-blind, 24 curfews

Raise up the bridge, lower the portcullis
Rain forks into mutton, no abort button
Core pump, assorted color sugar water
Poor lummox, unexplained ailments and doesn't work well with others
Wet nose on the glass, Garibaldi half cookie dough
Lock jaw, Don 4 walls like a wooden coat
Behold the rotting fruit of excommunication:
A ruby tide insubordinate to lunar phases
That maneuver past the beaches to the bosom of the pavement
Now the bow drill smolder in a flooded bit of basement
Grace of a misled teen who prefers his scenes with a little Wilhelm scream
The ambush predator edition
Skill set of Will Tell aim and speed over short distance
Part hatter-mad, part erratic habitat
Dark matter harnessing his heart attack-ack-ack-ack-ack

Midsummer, bit crusher, midwinter, bit shifter
Midsummer, bit crusher, midwinter, bit shifter
No sleep, gold mine, front door circled
Proceed, low light, 24 curfews

Midsummer, bit crusher, midwinter, bit shifter
Midsummer, bit crusher, midwinter, bit shifter
Crows beak, cold night, unmoored virtue
Proceed, snow-blind, 24 curfews

Somebody in a cultivated moment of distress
Composed themselves enough to artfully carve "Zoso" in his desk
They was probably thinking "fuck you, fuck you, fuck you!" in they head
With a hell bound arm in a acidy wash
Homemade curfew a thousand o'clock
And the pot leaf tattoo his friend did drunk
Like a badge of mystique though it technically sucked
Taking the name of the father in vain
On the way to the blade in his locker
Estranged
A switch he lifted from a sibling's skivvy drawer
Who'd branched off into ninja stars
And never knew his shit was sharked to
Here with a higher purpose
And a prime alert to juvenile berserkers
Like Crocea Mors in a arcade drop claw
Gouging a valentine for Miss Othmar
Watch
Capital Zed, slowly maneuver the O
S is the most difficult to control
Finally O
Into the eye of Goliath you go
That levy crushin' percussion'll pull the monkey upright
Twelve or ghetto blaster
Black or technicolor telecaster
Lecture at a faster rate than class was making them develop backwards
It would appear you spelled out all the answers

When they ask how you, feeling you, tell em you, feeling like
Something important died screaming, you, tell em you, feeling like
Something even more important arrived breathing, something you should probably try feeding
When they ask how you, living you, tell em you, living like
Something important died hissing, you, tell em you, living like
Something even more important arrived giving
Something you should probably try willing

(alright, same here)

Somebody in a cultivated moment of distrust
Composed themselves enough to magic-marker “Zulu” on these chucks
They was tryin to do the buckle font from ‘Renegades of Funk‘
In a 3d frame of exploding brick
And whiz-lines for the locally motion sick
Beyond gross but evoked a host of “oh dip”
Where a social neurosis owned the whole strip
Heart of a cat with a lark in his mouth
In the marrow of waiting his guardians out
Flashlight
Chisel tips
Milked venom
Pistol grip
Images relocated from milled vellum to scissor kick
Silent agreement at hand
King of the hill for a queen of the damned
She in the doorway seething began
“That clean white pair had a 3-year plan”
Oops
Capital “ZED” Radical “U” in the cut
Truly to beautiful “L"oser it up "U" and he done
Collateral damage a future alum that key to Shambala
Planet rocking Bambaata
Sample chop
Churning out a cancer for the vandal squad
Analog
And he finds
Animated colors on a page
Like synthesized cultures on a stage

When they ask how you, feeling you, tell em you, feeling like
Something important died screaming, you, tell em you, feeling like
Something even more important arrived breathing, something you should probably try feeding
When they as how you, living you, tell em you, living like
Something important died hissing, you, tell em you, living like
Something even more important arrived giving
Something you should probably try willing

(alright, same here)

Somebody in a cultivated moment of resolve
Composed themselves enough to publicize "the Zeros" in this stall
They was scoping every dog and pony previously scrawled
With a festering hate for the gum drop edge
‘Disco sucks’ tee, punk‘s not dead
But a transient teen unsung godsend
Via 3 bar chords and a mugshot grin
(Cheese!)
Sign of a runaway tone in the face of authority, thumbing it's nose
Cutting it's teeth
Pretzled up in special order vinyl, and
Birds that dip their belts in little metal porcupine quills
2 dutch at a show in the front, low-key to the can
For a smoke and a fuck, Trixie, fixing her lipstick up
When his mitts got bit by the mischief bug
Snatch
Capital “zed”, terrible “e” in vermillion red
Gimme an “R", "O” and a slippery “s”
Over a web of the shittiest bands
That beat your heart out
Never bleeped your favorite parts out from a learned curve
Of bird fingers bursting out of germs burns
Urgently
Offered through the circuits of an earlier plot
I’ll see you at the bottom ZZZ top

Baseheads locally approach all spark plugs
Total disregard for a dying man's shark jump
Post-meridiem pretty tungsten attracts any once—pale horse painted gunmetal black
Face masking, hard-shelled ebony propeller hat
Clubmans, gloved rakes grappling the clutch span
Tuck go the steel toe, metal gate spreading
For the dead-alive that rented parking space 37
2000 out the weekly under "Cycles to Gehenna" gets him floating over 20 busses
Fireproof and festive
Corners like a two-tired tiger so a too-tired rider can accumulate a few excited fibers to assign
Knows no zen in the art of maintenance
Only as the orchestrated patron saint of changing lanes baby
Here is how a great escape goes when you can't take your dead friends names out your phone

Eyes and teeth, new moon on a scale that defies belief
Outside what our fundamental sciences teach, every other mighty lion asleep
Gangway - mine eyes, mine teeth

The man-ape translates glam thru the visor
Goes in water lillies
Am-scrays Giger, and man—ray
Crammed in a one-player campaign
Blinker like a hallowed bonfire over Samhain
Span where the praying hands mandate
Bars an extension of the arms
They're mutating instead of being farmed
Tonight beneath a marmalade venus
Haunted mowers chewing every glowing yard of mud between us
Going Ford, Jag, Datsun, Corvette, Lotus
All cones you can slalom when your Zorlac's focused
Via mechanical Dartmoor Frankensteined poorly
And sanctioned by a New Yank Yorkee
Who knew that any moment he could lose it to the decopaged suicide flooring
And still he keep his fuel tank portly, the 30 odd year old gears thank charlie
The scarf thank Mom's new hobby, kssssht! copy

Eyes and teeth, new moon on a scale that defies belief
Outside what our fundamental sciences teach, every other mighty lion asleep
Gangway - mine eyes, mine teeth

It was less of an act of hubris
More a lonely hearts club at the helm of a magic bullet
Away on a relentless bid for rarefied inertia
Rattletrap forks married to the patchy terra firma Ursa Minor getting warmer
I crowbar into the pecking order
The dreck between the whores and Betty Ford-ers
Hug a double yellow spine
Knobby rubber like a rat on a rope
Those little fuckers run on passion alone
This is the product of a d.i.y. inadequate home
Grabbing a cabin in the-fuck-outta-dodge
Actin' a savage in the shadows of Rome
Traffic amassed against insufferable odds
Fashioning gallows out of plastic and bone
I got the motordrome walls of death splintering under me
All-city galvanized bikes white knuckling
Bright light, tunnel kings tuck in the devil
PS - I wrote this on a self-destructing memo...

They did not know how long they had been there

Look…
Unsigned hype, front line aeronauts flurry
Zero dark thirty
Zero Friends minotaur-fugly stepchild
Evoke lunch jumped over plunging necklines
Up, beside tongue-tied hungry enzymes
Devolved into mothmen munching textiles
Punisher, out past go-time
Back 10 fried worms chubbier
Brown grass both sides
Canned food, manmade tools
Lanacane, band aids, mandrake root
Bindle on a broomstick, pancaked shoes
And a handshake-proof campaign, can’t lose
Can’t gain
Smoke out moles like a force of nature
Pray fortune return to his favor, swiftly
Maybe in the form of a nest egg
Maybe in the form of a Tesla death ray
Or a solid gold scene with something better to celebrate
Than powder on a face like a flatfoot on jelly day
M-m-moral compass all batshit
Spinning in the shadows of immoral magnets
Are we supporting the artist or enabling the addict
I mean, I guess it matters to me, I wish it mattered to you
How a thousand virtues
Kick the same bucket like chinatown turtles

Roving packs of elusive young become
Choke-lore writers over boosted drums
In the terrifying face of a future tongue
Down down from a huntable surplus to one x5

(Check his own) Breakneck pulse over colors in a drain
That emote sugar skulls in the rain
Flower-eyes melting
Guided by a levee made of bath tiles, tilting
Quarter up and headed for the kill screen
No corner cut, no build team
Only a particularly menacing
Angle perpendicular to everything
Boys room cherry bomb
Boy/goon very much runnin' with the devil in the mellotron
Hello! Here’s where a tale of caution
Pounds coffin nails to bootlegs of Hawkwind
Saw tooth, nevermind straw to gold
Spin hearts on sleeves into heads on poles
Arm in the maw
Fish out pith like a business card from a jar at the mall
A-alike androids dreaming of carbon applause
Get stuffed with cartoon cigars
Cold pack, neti-pot, home to roost
Around folk backed into what they most lampoon
Shook to the fevered brow and broke ankles
Daisy, declawed pound, no thank you
Fade me, failed all basic training
But I spent a couple groundhog days with a changeling
Silhouette, the god’s last cigarette
Anything less would be ri-god-damn-diculous

Let me put you up on Bob's donuts
Controller of the warm deep fryer that charms cobras
Mostly it was aggravated ulcers over goat's legs
Will they go for maple, custard, buttermilk or wolfs bane?
Hm, late after your cinderella pulsate and crash I was rotating casts
Picture if you will a witching hour on a weak night in the trenches
Where paranoia dead-ends in a bright florescent heaven
With sprinkles, I know right yum
Whether tummy ache or fever
Keep the funnel cake I'm honey glaze in vitro
In the company of similar believers
Sleepless, who hear the walls breath and foam at the facial features
Now the yeast, a phoenix in the partially hydrogenated
Equal parts flour, faith, healing
Might replace your previously nominated Jesus
But only if you privy to the following secret of all secrets

Shh, every night at 12 they would march out from the back
With a tray of raw dough for the pool of hot fat
Show up around 1 never get your God back
If you're just tuning in, walk into the light
Walk into the light

I boil oil too, not for scarfing
For CCs of Japanese innovation that screech into free parking
Purple heart and second chin that beseech him to squeeze the carbs into the motherboard
You can chew the Eucharist in cruller form
Locally a seedy danish underworld is bustling
Where jelly's not a celebrated stuffing, it's a puppet string
Pluck, nose for canola
5 cow stomachs like a mime with a rope going nowhere
Fast, right hand of god on my shoulder, crows feet swollen, dopey
Combing apple fritters over with folk of opposing cultures
Baby sitter cop thief reverend, body glitter, botched c-section, bronze teeth
Each progressively more sequestered
Yet if threatened will defend the raisin bread as codefendants
Some lose religion or view it as superstition
You can tell a friend if you are down to kill them

Shh, every night at 12 they would march out from the back
With a tray of raw dough for the pool of hot fat
Show up around 1 never get your God back
If you're just tuning in, walk into the light
Walk into the light

The fat boys are back, foam fingers over open arms
To feverishly reclaim their stomachs from golden jars
And stagger through the pulse ofthe gulch on a builder's dividends
Hiding high behind his guilty powdered-sugar fingerprints
Seething eventide fever, sidewalk feeling a little dicey
I'm snake-eye straight to the cakes icing
Might, fortune-teller up your favorite paper tiger stripe
Great, grace invaders, the first-name basis patron haters
Who compromise the pilot lights and flavors
Silent night, holy night, invite the pious out the pagan
Midnight kitchen doors un-caging the enablers like butchers in bloody aprons
Can I get a fucking amen?
AMEN, hazelnut raiders of the lost, navigate consecutive pastries like stations of the cross
No name no dayjob
Know the folk where it virgin mary toast by the loaf
Thanks bob

Shh, every night at 12 they would march out from the back
With a tray of raw dough for the pool of hot fat
Show up around 1 never get your god back
If you're just tuning in, walk into the light

Here we go, happy holidays

July 4th, 1981, candles of a Roman ilk
Unloaded from a chevy truck Into the home her folks had built
Patio was charcoals and extended fam in folding chairs
Safely arced around the yard to focus on the smoking flares
Couple cousins, uncles, aunts, mostly grown-ups, couple brats
Baby Ruby's only two She's too close to the jumping jacks
Mommy scoops her to the house/Buckles up the booster seat
Rolls her to the storm door
Let her long for all the lunacy
Telephone distracting Mom/Ruby wriggles out her strap
Fingers push the plexi-glass/She's off into the sour patch
Past the pyrotechnics undetected and invisible
Woke the sleeping beagle skipping toward the kidney swimming pool
Off into the yawning blue/The splash would mum the rocket-ships
Ruby's lungs were filling by the time her kin were cognizant
Many sprung and sprinted down All arrive belated but
The beast she had earlier bestirred had been alert since waking up
Canine let his gainer fly/Water top commotion grow
Howling guests assumed the cloven hooves had come to do-si-do
Frenzied and congested deck Part to let the elders see
Soggy beagle gently dragging Ruby in his yellow teeth
Laid the tiny body in the sun before her Father‘s feet
When she choked the liquid through her bluish lips he dropped his knee
Healthy air had reconvenedTowel his shaking Ruby off
EMT confirm the save,Everybody say "Good dog!"

4 and 20 gory pantone black crows shredding innards
The silouettes are fencing lefty scissors
Separating horn and hoof as evil's own arpeggiators
They piggy back the tombs of all your deadest friends and neighbors
Buy the getty image, green-cheese moon
Dead-of-winter shit, graveyard tchk! tchk!
Shifter shit, brother was a face card
Crown like a heart-shaped tunnel of woven branches leaning in over his hydro-plaining pace car chase...
Wait up let me isolate the bass more
Gate of god's acre
Aim to rake the snow off each forsaken name here
Supposedly closure'l free the vipers out the bosom
Personally I think it's a bunch of bullshit
Prisoners, tradition is for lovers
God forbid he flip the witch against her coven on some ‘dip or play the dozens‘
Now I baptize skips in larvae and dental records
On a little plot pregnant with 6 million sentence-enders
And the tech support for tragedy's emphatically horrendous
Teenage operators explaining what bated breath is
Pass, I wish it were something I could diagram on a napkin so you won't feel so detached if it should happen to you privately
Publicly your shadows'll cat call back
Happy to split the button eye and burlap doll
Crack the crypt
Bats eject like cousin death's wing-ed lapdogs ricocheting sonar of the sacrilege
Now let me slow this whole shit down for all you half-goat cowards
I'll even grit my teeth for you
I am so completely off the god-damn grid it's not a question of addressing me
It's "what do these symbols under the dresser mean"
Perhaps a little dash of karma chameleons through the entropy for good/young
Could've used a good lung
Still, proximity to corpses wasn't nothing to the kid but unforgiving science or cinematic horrors
Fast forward, my knee in the gut of a glass coffin
"remember that cow in the dean's office seems awkward
And I know your people donated pints to the same pavement but for ash and bone to share a space with strangers seems outrageous, ain't it?
Maybe a dialog of howls that reshapes thejowls and face somehow relates to whatever you have found among a thousand cloned shrines
Either way - dope stone lion

Everything you think you're hiding shows
In the way you view the graves like a string of tiny thrones
Messages you'd tucked away for keeps has resurfaced to be heard amidst the butchery and beaks
You don't want the passengers to pass
You want each cow taxidermy'd fatter than the last
Mausoleum lighting is a rush
While it might enhance a silhouette it might expose a crutch
A proud chest puffed to the heavens
Holds nothing if we're cutting past the muscle and the tendon
And we will be cutting past the muscle and the tendon...

Watch your step, Watch your mouth
We all know the way that a punk goes out

4 and 21 crows
None go south
For the supper when a punk goes out
Checkerboard of mothballed death-forms
Hauled via vaudeville canes
And encased where the claw marks wane off broadway the god way
Watch, our father
Commuters from the farms with news of el Chupacabra
Who transfuse soup out a fresh punk skull
Dumb full blood suckers
Only the chum suffers
Pine box butcher
Encouraging poor lighting
Said “a pall bore's not a sure sign of jarred lightning"
Harsh, that's how the yellow spine-diner was born
Feral feeding that strung his organs up like tire swing art
Chippin' a drippy set of broke bone grinders
More for the hive mind
Less for the land mine finders
Fine, no defacto leaders in the eatery
Unless you count the way they led his heart through his tuxedo tee
Straight out the front

4 and 22
Cue the cut throat mouth
Chew together when a punk goes out
Etiquette of tart-tongued ghouls
Never run truck jewels
Run a culinary school for gluttony-drunk wolves
In guttural grunts
Smothering buttery lung ramen
Early sign of punk shows up on the diagnostic
Hm, pardon if I seem stand off-ish
All the see-sawed loss, I can't call it
All petite drawn straws and orange caution
Or outcast creeps re-involved for absolvement
It's gaudy, plus when a hell-bound offspring and yours share an office, all evolves salty
Watch, if fortune is a bitch with venom and laser tits
Maybe sin ‘ll make for sugar-flavored flesh
Kings taste terrible at best and rest in peace raw
The rest are recipes
Caw!

Grows back
Dude, it grows back
It's ok it grows back
Ma!

There is a bowl cut template mapped with a billy can
Mega mom scissoring a topiary lego man
Mini-ramp cowlick
Good ship snot nose
Lap rain water out of pigeon hill potholes
Rat brain, shovel green peas offa butterknife
Racoon hat, moon boots all summer-type
Felt pressure at the center of the dog show
Better off blending, sweater—off Waldo
You! Wanna see a genome mutate?
Cut a page boy ‘til it bring home a Cube tape
Poof, screw-face wriggle out a chop shop
Home-brewed Kool-aid, Disavowing Osh Kosh
Simulating television
Little rowdy rock snob
Bobble-headed shredder playing top-heavy hop scotch
You realize you only got a week
‘til you catch him with a set of shitty clippers in the sink
Like bzzzzt, motherfucking bzzzzt, bzzzzt
That's a quiet kid, buzzing asymmetric rebel lines in
Crudely, some say to praise the lord
I say you wanna feel saved baby shape the orb
And I will see you all in Helven
Read he fled a panic room pissed
And been searching for animal chin since
Bumpin' Johnny Rad, eye on the sauce pan
Current mop: 4 months shy on the off-chance
Might just reset this whole shit

Start with a text book bowl cut (Bowl cut!)
One you can mow down slow as you grow up
Learn a couple great new curse words (Pussy!)
Buzz a cool rat tail, take 2, your turn

“Haircuts! Get your five dollar haircut here! I can do mohawks, fauxhauks, afros, halfros, racing stripes, fringes, high top fades, mullets, reverse mullets, crew cuts and much much more!"

"No, I just needed a little off the top"

"Mirror? No, you can’t look in a mirror, trust me, you look awesome!"

"I just want to take a look"

"Give me another buck and I'll trim"


I knew this kid Camu who in the lion's mouth
Made up a fail safe way to get his life corralled
Let's say he short on the rent
His land lord is upset
He disappears with sheers yelling "I'm going George Jeff"
Bathroom door sound like a part—mech barbershop quartet
Forced into war with itself
What emerge next in a shaft of light is bald up top
Long on the back and sides
Maybe the blade oil came with a ax to grind
But granddaddy half-smile, all mastermind
He asked, "How do I look?"
I said, "You look insane"
He said the haircut come with a theory, I'll explain
Please do
First: no hats allowed
Faux nat' male pattern when he out the house
And wouldn't crop it up until his monopoly prop pass go
‘til then walk this town like an asshole
Bzzzt! Motherfucking bzzzt bzzzt!
Last week we were stoney
This week he program beats all Monday, sold two Wednesday
Pay rent, fabricate a whole new hedge maze
Back on his smooth shit Friday at noon bitch
Wow, just like that
A method I encourage you to share and apply and adapt
As one day his didn't grow back
So, if yours does, get that zig zig zag

Start with a text book bowl cut (Afro!)
One you can mow down slow as you grow up
Learn a couple great new curse words (Fuckface!)
Maybe try a pony hawk, take 2, your turn

Fasten your seatbelts, remove glasses

Bright lights, bright lights

I wear shoes to bed
Paint teeth on my lips
Trench foot, gangrened for the win
Blitzkrieg Bopper
Petitioned out of shit's creek proper
The only inaccessible blip on the streaming doppler
Screaming ‘uncle’ in a sea of TV doctors
Free to occupy the same space in differing degrees of seedy commerce
The shot is slow pan, monitor guffawing
Flooded p.d. blotter under horizontal coffee
More to follow, outside tweakers are in love
Teeny Raque Welch submarining through the blood, voyagers
Poisoned or maybe just a misfit toy or two
Depending on the beacon that your voyeurs choose
That sorta hemming and hawing‘ll haunt your boiler rooms abysmally
And kidnap rapid eyes in their infancy
Everything his cutting room scrapped
On a silver screen that throws gummy bears back, attack!

All these tribes hoard breads and wines
These climates transform men to swine
(AGAIN!)
All these hives hide knives and lead
These bribes can't transform swine to men

Sensible sweater on ice
Devil horns high
Like shovels above a butter lamb with peppercorn eyes
Vendetta-drunk leader squealing
"it's the real pig fever"
Sick people pinky swearing on concealed 6th fingers
That's idle handwork in the spirit of death dealers
Look at mommy's little Hercules
Custom Troy Hurtubise
Flourish in the blind spot of Spittle County 'Gore Police'
Or really any readily ebbing and flowing 'War and Peace'
1 plain brown key foods bag head
2 holes later I'll see to this loose flatbread
Cats fucked off, at exactly what cost
The currency of brotherhood back in his cut palm
It sucks, it's nauseating dawn crawling with bugs
They seem attracted to the matters ofthe morally snubbed
See my ‘Goodnight Irene' massacred flat in the key of tragedy
Whole diner like "i'll have what he's having"

All these tribes hoard breads and wines
These climates transform men to swine
(AGAIN!)
All these hives hide knives and lead
These bribes can't transform swine to men

Aggravated brain stick, motion sick
They peel back slow and expose the whole shit
Brain set drum speed to ultimate
Break bones in the throws of moments so ill

Today a thousand sea lions got up and left a pier
They had successfully invaded and secured for 20 years
Some said it was the food supply or shifting weather patterns
Truthfully a whole community of scientists are baffled
In '89 maybe 10 showed up at the wharf
As if guided by the trident of poseidon to cavort
Each a lumbering and boisterous glutton
Like a half-ton annoyance ‘til the heart-warming story went public
You'll need a montage, animals arriving in droves
A bottom dollar turns a nuisance to the pride of your cove
Which bring us back up to this morning when the colony dove
I got a couple unsubstantiated thoughts of my own they go
Maybe it'd feel more majestic and less fatty
If a 12 year old wasn't beaning it with salt water taffy
Every 5 fucking seconds, sounds like your basic
Liberating moment of collective "fuck fame" shit

All these tribes hoard breads and wines
These climates transform men to swine
(AGAIN!)
All these hives hide knives and lead
These bribes can't transform swine to men

How to make a homemade mummy:
Get a corpse, get gauze, get comfy
Shampoo and disinfect dead fluffy
For the hallowed excavation of his x-marked tummy
Stem to stern, the butter cutter b-lines well
Tongues butterfly the unzipped feline shell
We'll be escorting vital organs
With the exception of the precious kitten heart
Into the privacy of separate pickle jars
Or mayonnaise or jelly pick a card
Shit, pick a part and scissor
Stomach, lung, intestine or liver
In a world of sanitizers and preservatives forever
Brain exterminated through the whiskers *kiss & blow*
Ditched, I blank NY alone
We usher in the salts that call the husk home
Might embalm and stiffen and rid the fawn of all his liquids
Slather it in beeswax, wrap it up in ribbons
Limb by limb, by tail by ear by chin
Within the hereafter I hereby win
I hope you vow to meow another day and never
Decompose, by the way before we seal these molds
The shorten version goes...

Take the brain out, leave the heart in [X2]
Paper playgrounds, leave your harvest
Take the brain out...

Gadzooks, punk's dead, last good gut wrenched
Antennae sam cook, black book pushead
Cat skulls stacked to the black hole sunset
Olive on a toothpick, Dagwood Bumstead
Tagged-hoof hatchery, matter amass naturally
Bad wolf, dash for the last rook castling
Blue ox, red plaid bass pro flannel king
Hasbro crown, sour apple Abba-Zabba teeth
In poorly taken pictures antiquating on his mantlepiece
Before we only spoke in letters cut from magazines
Folk broke bear claws over gross coffee
Not as milquestoast men, as los muertos walking
Ergo the scarecrow in rare barley
Squared-off harpy to armchair: say a prayer for me
I feel that mystifying times have gotten ugly
I also feel that you could learn a lot from a mummy

Take the brain out, leave the heart in [X2]
Major take down, eat your porridge
Take the brain out, leave the carcass

Take the brain out, leave the heart in [X2]
Games to rain out, pleas to bargain
Take the brain out, wreathed in garlic

Take the brain out, leave the heart in [[X2]
Fading halos, feeding herpes
Take the brain out, eager starlets

Take the brain out, leave the heart in

Ian why don't you say grace
"dear god thanks, and if you loved me vegetables would be extinct"
Now I'm looking down the barrel of a string-bean side like an exodus of biblical proportion redefined
Rectangle seat 4, squeeze 5
Each one may not be excused from the table ‘til the green gone
Stomach revvin‘ up an episodic rerun
Where's a dissipating plume of smoke when you need one?
Chris and Graham hate ‘em too but advocate a braver chew invented for the code red, cola chaser, nose held, gulp!
Moments later 2 have been released
Leaving me the legroom and the legume police
Going "freeze, you with the pretzeled arms
Send your fabricated nausea my best regards
And know this kitchen as a prison ‘til the pea pods die
I could sit here all night"
So could I

Who was at the door just now?
Kids on dirt bikes asking you to bunny-hop the curbsides Really?
Yup I told em "oh he busy, he staring at his green beans being a total pussy
Who was at the door just now?
Kids on skateboards asking you to navigate the claymores Really?
Yup, I told em "oh he can't, he in the kitchen pouting and terrified of a plant"

Blink Twice if you are being held hostage
I speak and spell of a sleeper cell in the hospice
Woke, impersonating busy little helpers
That intimately purr between the hiccuping up of feathers
Pick a porcelain dish
A single portion canned
Frozen or fresh
Defies the glory of the Poultry or fish
Via communal bloodletting that rupture spud levy
No '87 supper-scape was truly flood-friendly, ever
Including at your basic cemetery for contaminated textures 60 minutes into never
Where room temp heirlooms emanate a crude black mist
To a rendition of "dude, dad's pissed"
Tell dad dude's pissed too
Not to mention genuinely brandishing a the new gill hue
Still out-mule any last strafing watchmen
‘Til the lord taketh waiting as an option

Less like toes in a tide pool
More like, left, right, poached from notable giant Kaiju
Fat neck, fine tooth, rock and lean, yelling
"this ends now eat the god damn beans!" ah!
Hangdog mouth talk slang wrong and that there's flatware exhumed by a crane arm
Time for some action
Stab one ripe for a swipe and extraction
Brined in malpractice
Carried to the cavernous yap and obliged access
If only in compliance with a deep-fried fascist, peep
Literally bite down once
And my tongue get a flooding from my uninvited guts
Pointer finger plug a hole in the dam
Ma notice, "ok gross, blowfish, dinner's over, go spit", pop call "bullshit"
Both of my brothers break in, like "he's on his Davie Hogan no mistakin'", by the way

Step on the lawn I keep the foot, peep
In the pot go six degrees of cooked geese;
Boiling, blitz the beach of mushed peas
Over ten meat hooks with a blister each
I'm all pincer, fevery hoodie-on hoodie-off
Sweat through his E.T. sheets to the worry dolls
Never met a quiet storm
That didn't grow into a choir of colliding horns
That go "click click clack" in territorial syntax
Sitting on the porch with his lids pinned back
Pinball whiz in a thimble of Sims
I'm a symbol of whimsy abridged
Kiss Me, I'm Dead; nursing a mystery, DayQuil
Led Zep staring daggers down page mill
How pray tell do he sit pretty?
When the old one-two unglue in a tizzy

Please hold for the don't-play dull boy
Click: I am not a page or a pull toy
Came in the door and the floor is lava
Killjoy if your core more Norman Rockwell
Born homesick for an invisible address, batshit
Bumble and bat around catnip
One black-heart Katamari massive
Packed in a fat category-5 rat nest
Nose on his sleeve, holes in his inner peace
Robot phone like a tentacle of flippancy
I hate you (I hate you more)
No, I hate you infinity
And Pangaea break into smithereens
Interlude presto change-o
If it move too quick (oh whey oh)
Right brain go write train Ramo
Mustache any old Monet, (no)
Yes

Merrily merrily merrily merrily
In a cobweb tomb on a hotbed of heresy
Frogmen schooled by the god Ed Emberley
Pull dog sleds and exhume Dead Kennedys
Bet: moth into kerosene awful
A caution to straw men lost on Vaudeville
Amorally mixing business
With 144 Dixie Whistlers
Lawnchair strongman twisted whiskers
NASCAR Bic in his missing fingers
Outcast from a system of kiss-the-ring-ers
Are you privy to the misadventures?

It's electric, meeting in the middle of the street
With a lethally modified Piccolo Pete
There is admittedly an incredible mystique
To meddling in the reason a city won't sleep
48 strings of twelve
That ring ring ring whiz-bang jingle bells
And melt bootleg G.I. Joes to black taffy
Classic fire-in-the-hole backdrafting
Fold wildlife out of Wolf Pack wrapping
Full moon, bad knee, wool hat, caffeine
TNT plunger in all-caps ACME
Blast off half of the whole damn mapscreen
No sling no spear
I'm a patchwork of 86'd springs and gears
Who been stung by an unlinked pinky swear
During his what-in-the-fuck-was-I-thinking years
Maybe an awkward phase
Like his acne and sophomore fade, played
Calling all out-of-work action figures
It was death by Saturn Missiles

Don't fool with his cool

I turn a staff to a snake and back, evade crack
Shake a 5150 in shades and a fake stache
Dirtbike made of 5 worse bikes, uphill
Tabletop frames on dutch tilt, crush kill
Maker bot coin-op arcade punk
Talkin’ arcane science, dark age pulp
Four eyes carb face, Bar-Kays iron on
Pork rinds orangeade, Jarred brains die alone
No Mulligans, crow bars bird cage
Cold, colonize Mars on Earth day
And surface from the cellar door like worms into the petrichor
Messenger, better yet a vessel for a Tetris score
Zilch, cowabunga homies call me “press ignore”
Devastating energy exploding off his Tesla coil
Farm baited breath and tempermental tremors
That taught a man to wave with 10 percent of his fingers
And I never lost tic tac toe to a live chicken
For the footage, I’m off cam dynamite fishin’
For diamondback rattles in his holy grail
Evoke colony collapse via gross betrayal
3 wolf moon shirt, two shoes one sock
Wore the same hoodie everyday like Mumm-Ra
Buh-dum-bum, follow the regenerated rebel flesh
Out of sorts, out of water, suicidal tetrafish
Who stood by the conviction in his we should be together less forevermore
Before we are the severed heads of civil war
Invasive radio ricochet off the silver foil
Trash can fire looking for a kill to grill or spoil
Quickly, purveyors of fine hijinks
I know, this is why we can’t have nice things
I prefer to skip the pleasantries
Flip the diner table, dip in time for final jeopardy

No shit
Oh and don’t fool with his cool
Ma, can we get a pool?
… Is that a no?

Okay, magpies, Hoarders, and allied forces
Who lick zig-zags being dragged by horses
Transcribe stories in patterns of pins dropping
Skinned boars and exaggerated limb-lopping
Slow Mozart, no I’ve never heard of knocking
Might’ve burst in on it, splits or skin popping
Opt out, sober on the eve of no saints day
Locate and aim for the token propane tank
Bang! Followed from a pulling of hair
To a homecoming sullied by a skull on a spear
It spun a human resources issue to public affair
Reciprocity is a pestilent compulsion to bear
And ultimately unfulfilling, concurrently that rigid upper lip and grudge are crippling
The wonder twins of bitching
Armchair hater, I wouldn’t piss on your coffin
But when I see your picture I draw dicks on it
The Ozone breakaway tux
Holds chicken wire ribs and paper mache guts
Pipe cleaner mustache, rope hands google eyes
Macaroni gas face, no plan to humanize
You are now rockin’ with the worst
Nothing up his sleeve, nothing here is what it seems
Paranormal weather, mysteriously disappearing bees
Not to mention the collateral delirium it breeds
Jeez, forgive him any dicey past
He from a tiny town called Deaths Icy Grasp
And he don't get out much, but when he do it's Beatlemania
Do not be asleep at the feet of his feelers radius
Too charitable, offerin’ the average joe some real estate
Between the Big Mouth Billy Bass and jackalope
Cozy in a moment of bliss
Snatch the food off your plate, snatch a goat off a bridge
No shit

Uh, greasy grimy gopher guts
Poolside, O for 1 and don't forget spoons twice
Lukewarm folgers; mold on his moonpie
Rooms in his home that dissipate into fruit flies
Suicide lane wide load ride looting in the wake of an amicable marooning
My duty go from moving in packs to sharing food with a cat
To Mom "It's me, I accidentally sawed a woman in half"
She said "I'll keep you in my prayers," I said "I need to hide a body"
She said "Ok, honey, talk to you on Friday"
Apparently we share a common plasma so the growing disconnection doesn't matter, according to the blood-and-water chapter
Weird, who wrote the blood-and-water chapter anyway?
Probably some surly dad, only child, 30 cats
Looking for a way to reconnect with an averted past
Except it doesn't always work like that

Today I pulled three baby snakes out of moss and dirt
Where the wild strawberry vines toss and turn
I told them, "You will grow to be something inventive and electric;
You are healthy, you are special, you are present"
Then I let them go
Oh...

You were sitting at the gate awaiting spirits and provisions
I was privy to a headache over pirouetting innards
In the mirror sweating pitchers; who's there: simian or lizard?
As it were there is a disappearing difference
In ambition and material;
Antiquated gentleman outlaws reduced to a ferris wheel of vitriol
Move as a godless heathen; black gums, tooth gone, bootleg 'Yukon Cornelius'
I'm a... That's better, here we here we go
Disenchanted face printed on a zero-dollar bill
Got a little plot of land where authority isn't recognized
Contraband keeping the core of his Hyde Jekyll-ized
Check! Never mind a misanthrope vying for affection to the wretched sound of mysticism dying
It is something he must handle on his own; the wind blown way, wanna win? Don't play

Today I pulled three green frogs out of leaf and bark
Where the grape vines climb a convenient barn
I told them, "You will grow to be something tenacious and exalted;
You are mighty, you are gracious, you are lauded"
Then I let them go
Oh..

I have been completely unable to maintain
Any semblance of relationship on any level
I have been a bastard to the people who have
Actively attempted to deliver me from peril
I have been acutely undeserving of the ear that listen up
And lip that kissed me on the temple
I have been accustomed to a stubborn disposition
That admits it wish its history disassembled
I have been a hypocrite in sermonizing tolerance
While skimming for a ministry to pretzel
I have been unfairly resentful of those I wish
That acted different when the bidding was essential
I have been a terrible communicator
Prone to isolation over sympathy for devils
I have been my own worst enemy since the very genesis of rebels

Today I pulled three ghost crabs out of rock and sand
Where the low tide showcased a promised land
I told them, "You will grow to be something dynamic and impressive;
You are patient, you are gallant, you are festive"
Then I let them go
Oh

(On and on and on and on...)

I spell 666 star six nine click
Give his telephone a Viking funeral, bye bitch
Treble hook two birds, cheap thrills, free meal
Vacate Jellystone Park with your brie wheel

Up around noon
Found everything he loved crushed down to a cube
The new Kowloon chowline, two leads routing medicine and gruel
One is hemorrhaging money, the other jettisoning fuel
Identical water-separated pools
It was clever
But it wasn't ever neighborhood-degenerate approved
In swooped jukebox Fonzie, promptly
Bolts on his neck, one tubesock wonky

There is a wildly elusive moment of bliss
In the spaces between being told you are shit
I would openly suggest identifying the closest
And collectivly agreeing to meet if the sky opens

Aggravated people driving lemons over limits
With a neck bop stemming and a cartoon physics
Smart move taught never broadcast holes in his armor
End up another poached foreigner

Untrained pet with a pen name
Chest pain, bet he outlive his own endgame, anyway
Step around the rhythm of the red rain
Getaway car horn, stand by, tenth frame

You want to know why? Because I'm
Dead messengers buried in their Melvin shirts
Awoken as reanimated mummies from the sepulcher
Anonymous and secular and ribbons and exposed brain
Roll with grown men who still use code names
Fold crawl space on the SS coat tails
Might chase six legs through his oatmeal
Oh dear, no pets eat his own homework
Pet cruise cobble step shoes that are bone bugs
Holmes, sick to the fishbone comb
My yellow brick shtick ain't tip toe prone
It's a misthrown sticky bomb slipping off the fingers wrong
Any blips you're witnessing are living in the Sigma laws
Blip, blip, dag, these ghosts need a doctor
Shelter, clean Dunlops on a walker
She sells sea shells he, draws revenge
Plots on a chalkboard, watch what you walk toward

At night I wear a wolf's head on my regular head
Consider an irregular character sketch
Food hoarder, communes with the flora
Computes in cahoots with beauty and brute force
I've got a brand new normal at a thirty in New York, plus
Years at the fire pulling portions out of corn husks
Never mind time on the short bus
Terrifying errant knights thwarting any motherfucking fork tongued-sport
Agita flashing the hind molars, though his body less a weapon more a bag of lipomas
Over medium, treat skin-tags like scratch-offs
Rap like black-ops, rappers like lap dogs
He got the rad moves, catty alpha rat-proof (wait)
Twenty-sided die at the crap-shoot (wait)
Looking for a black hole to casually collapse through
Try aisle nine by the cat food
There it is
Ooh wee, do we roast in a bilge, when the skinny from afar is "Thar be gold in them hills"
Time better let a couple truths decay, or somebody going to rue the day
Check, check, check

Catch 'em on the lam
(I ain't joking)
No maps, no muster point
(Nah, I ain't joking)
I put a pebble on a tomb
(I ain't joking)
Making bath tub meth
I'm joking
Here we go

The whip got a tongue and teeth
Too tough, two blood-shot eyes with a Tungsten bleep
When any putrefying arrow wants your lungs in reach
I field a vessel going zero to the fuck y'all think
And when your function fails I'm on an undisclosed island
Stroking exotic animals, open up rocket science
Leaning a jewellers loupe over a stolen sock 'o diamonds
Palm-made products a portrait of modern triumph, try us
Back at the battering ram post-haste
Cro-mags, wait till this Saturday plans grow legs
All you hear is intermittent code names
Ricochet around the geometry of a closed space
Unfrozen part of his new J.O
Face of divine evil, heart of Camu Tao
Some people find the daylight to be oddly alluring
I was in the dark, dodging and burning

Maybe cause I look like an ugly doll
(I ain't joking)
Pack a wallop in the wheelhouse
(Nah, I ain't joking)
Leave brass tacks everywhere
(I ain't joking)
I own many many homes
I'm joking
Here we go

All hock-tooie no costume
Black hoodie you can set your watch to
Tall drink, daps like an air raid
Radically detach with purveyors of the hair-brain
Down with the ship go a dozen fried wild links
Upperway, upper-case tri-state style kings
Get pie-faced, sent home tied to the sinewaves
Lights off, spine on sideways
Riding down the block, scooping Bobby in a boogie-down
Tony told me tell 'em "Hello, 7:30 noodle-town"
Cool 'em down, global domination over salt bake
Situation comedy in broke dude cosplay
You don't want a meeting on an off-day trading horror stories from the hollows
The summary is as follows:
"These hate those and this thinks, that's absurd"
Yip yap, y'all cats and birds

Meow meow meow meow meow
(I ain't joking)
Talking rubes on the radio
(Nah, I ain't joking)
Uh, suckers never play me
(I ain't joking)
I found Jimmy Hoffa's body
I'm joking
Here we go

The first step is a doozy, it’s roulette with a mood ring
The birth of an old slang, the death of a new speak
A permanent post-game is littered with bridge trolls
Skirting the copay, divvy the death toll
Innumerable codenames, alerted and mobile
Familiar rising, and furnacing cold piles
Resilient style kings, impossibly tantrum
Wandering wild things, obelisk phantoms
On linoleum or lava, leaders of a leadfoot fauna
His left source blunt force trauma
Not pillar of the commune, a splinter off the pagan
Who vote off the elusiveness of truth and exultation
From the point of view of students labeled putrid little aphids
By the beautiful and cryogenic stasis
Sadists, meanwhile makers of a hideous whatnot
Committed to a lowdown Sisyphus up-rock
Are shaving at a truck stop, aging exponentially
Homie, no myth flowers grow where he piss
And I still row boats outta bottles without abandon
To shrink into the sunset bumping Pachelbel's Canon
In D motherfucker, the author of the artistry
May or may not be weeping to an automated pharmacy

Hello. Hello? Shit

Too geeked up to even keep it down
Too peaced out to even be around
Too beat up to even breathe it out
(Too freaked out to even leave your house) x5

You wish you could dance more, I wish you would talk less
My gentleman transformed, to bringers of offed heads
Moments of land war, my Lazarus species
Tattered and bruised up, from back in the cheap seats
Hackers on crew cuts, foam at the mush mouth
Gag at the news truck, notably unsound
Dragging his clown shoes, food in his moustache
Raggedy hounds tooth, zilch on a bus pass
I’m good, house at the beach of expelled hubcaps
Black lawn, backyard melting into Lovecraft
Bad yarn spun by the hum of the bug zapper
Of kings becoming runners, and runts becoming alphas
And underdogs with posters of a front-side Tony Alva
On the sticker laden walls above their uncle’s Bowie albums
Graduate to flyers of an execrated sigil
And live to see another sexy generation fizzle
Out, keep rap homely
Bear claw slippers, over-sized Billy Joel tee
Fat-faced, potbelly, neckbeard, crow’s feet
Rat nest, gross teeth, pock marks, go team
I walk with Hawaii on a greenscreen behind me
So even the awkward pauses feel inviting
Standing at a landmark sleep drought keep out
Can’t talk now too freaked out

Tech support, feral army
In a cave on a failed bit of terraforming
4 corners of paranormal
Get shorn for a thermos and pair of thermals
In the warehouse air where his dairy curdles
St. Vincent de Paul trying to square the circle
Circle the source of his power
Foresight born at the corner of Howard on sale
Cherry pick blue in the pale
It's a blue-nose chewin' his tail
Losing his coat
Schmoozing a high and head-rush
Hack up bile over H1N1, and then some
One eye on the breadcrumbs
Other eye on the Drencrom
Other other eye on the income
Good knife and a grin
Shoot dice with the lice and the ring worms
Peg leg, smells like Medellin wake in the night
Make a pipe out of anything
Take 5, take a dive in the cellophane
Turn 5 into 5 6 7 8
Back out, black out somewhere fancy
Shaped like the backseat of Aesop's Camry
Dude... seat full of chips and sandwich meat from the crypt
In the end, if you give an address in a river of piss
Don't question the mystery fish
Just picture shrimp on a pillow of grits
Close your eyes, lick your lips
I'm at the cafe ordering a cup of fresh
Sarah gave me 2, I gave one to Rex
He said, "Fools ain't shit plus fuck the pigs
They could never understand what Sumner is"

(Word up, word up, word up)
I'm off the grid
I'm through the gate
I fly these kites into the fray
(Word up, word up, word up)
I'm out the box
I'm through the mud
I fly these kites into the cut

NorCal fried bacteria
No ID survive the vivarium
Try soft wheels, sourdough and heroin
Eat with the chimera, fly with the seraphim
Might hold court with the cats and dogs
Who hold Kools like an orb in a dragon's claw
In terry cloth robes outside detox surly
Curse at a beat cop, doctor a Slurpee
Adopt no Xerxes, fear no moon man
Stay true like a wolf wearing wolf pants
Oooh, never could avoid himself
For long enough to contain or employ as help
And now he look both ways at the asteroid belt
Buzzed, gross and wholly unloved
Still hear an ex in his head yelling, "kiss the ring"
From a fortune to Fisher King
Or from assisted care, blisters in his hair
New day, new diary of disrepair
Soups on, 2-ton crucifix to bear
No shoes, no shirt, no fiscal year
I said hello to Marshall every morn for 6
He yelled at me every time, that's amore, bitch
It only took one tooth to crack the bug juice and chug
Turn a bum to a Sun Tzu, it's bug
Outside home is an open swim
Occultism in the throws of corrosive wind
A cold meal with the ghosts of friends
A whole host of meds
A deal on a Tone Loc cassette
I stepped over a body in the door
I pretend he asleep but it's probably more, God damn
Profound apathy, heart with a crack
I'm ships in the night
I'm darts at a map
Word up

Used to draw
Hard to admit that I used to draw
Portraiture and the human form
Doodle of a two-headed unicorn
It was soothin', movin' his arm in a fusion
Of man-made tools and a muse from beyond
Even if it went beautifully wrong
It was tangible truth for a youth who refused to belong
No name nuisance, stews in a bedroom
Oozing a brand new cuneiform
Barely commune with the horde
Got a whole gray scale ungluing his world
Might zone out to the yap of the magpie
Unseen hand dragging his graphite
Cross contour, little bit of backlight
Black ink after a Bristol to baptize
You can't imagine the rush that ensue
When you get three dimensions stuffed into two
Then it's off to a school where it's all that you do
Being trained and observed by a capable few
Back in New York, five peeps and a dog
In a two-bedroom doing menial jobs
Plus, rhymin' and stealin' and being a clod
Distractions free to maraud
I left some years a deer in the light
I left some will to spirit away
I let my fears materialize
I let my skills deteriorate
Haunted by the thought of what I should have been continuing
A mission that was rooted in a 20-year affinity
In rickety condition with an ID crisis
Nap on the front lawn, look up in the sky, it's…

Shapes falling out of the fringe
All heart, though we would've made cowardly kings
They will chop you down just to count your rings
Just to count your rings, just to count your rings
And there were colors pouring out of the fringe
All heart, though we would've made cowardly kings
They will chop you down just to count your rings
Just to count your rings, just to count your rings

Used to paint
Hard to admit that I used to paint
Natural light on a human face
Stenciled fire on his roommate's bass
It was blooming addiction
Amiss in the pushing of pigment
Book like a tattooed pigskin, look
Pinhead kids of the minute
Drank Kool-Aid from a tube of acrylic
And it grew up into linseed oil over linen
Joy to the poison, voice of the resin
Capture a map of the gesture
Back up, add a little accurate fat to the figure
Redo that, move that inward
Zinc white lightning shoots from his fingers
Studio strewn with illusion and tinctures
Stay tuned for the spooky adventures
You can't imagine the stars that align
When a forearm starts foreshortening right
Or a torso hung on a warping spine
In proportion reads as warm and alive
Routine day with a dirt cheap brush
Then a week goes by and it goes untouched
Then two, then three, then a month
And the rest of your life, you beat yourself up
I left some seasons eager to fall
I left some work to bury alive
I let my means of being dissolve
I let my person curl up and die
Eating up his innards, an unfeasible anxiety
Has brutally committed to relinquishing his privacy
Aligning with the trials of the anti-Midas
Nap on the back lawn, look up in the sky, it's…

Shapes falling out of the fringe
All heart, though we would've made cowardly kings
They will chop you down just to count your rings
Just to count your rings, just to count your rings
And there were colors pouring out of the fringe
All heart, though we would've made cowardly kings
They will chop you down just to count your rings
Just to count your rings, just to count your rings

I'm getting sick and tired of never understanding
Where is the truth you promised?!

The kid that work down at the local Baskin-Robbins
Got a tattoo of a lipstick print attached above his collar
I watched him relocating pistachio to a waffle
Thinking I had lost the plot if not the passion for the novel
He asked me what I wanted, I ordered something daft
He said he liked the tattoo Alex drew me of the bats
Thanks
I like it too but modestly confess
In present company, my coloring is not the main event
Look at that neck
The message is immediate, the guy F's chicks
I spent a lot of years making friends with cool artists
So when they drew me tattoos I could truly feel important
Now some 22 year old inside a cube of brick and mortar
Got me questioning my morals and their corny pecking order
I should give a shit less
Cherry-No
Whip-Yes

Lotta years
Uh, lotta years

The girl that work down at the local juice place
Got a head full of dreadlocks down to her waist
I watched her add the spinach to the ginger to the grapes
My hair was underwhelming, my juice was fucking great
Some lady orders Maca, compliments the locks
She asked how many years it took the girl to grow the crop
"It took a lot of years and then eventually I cut 'em, kept 'em
Reattach 'em anytime I want 'em"
My mind's fucking blown
The future is amazing, I feel so fucking old
I bet you clone your pets and ride a hover-board to work
I used a folding map to find the juice place in the first
These kids are running wild, I'm still recovering from church
You should have seen me in the 90s, I could ollie up a curb
You should have seen me in the 80s
I was bumping New Edition, dragging acne into Hades

Lotta years
Naw mean? Lotta years

Question: If I died in my apartment like a rat in a cage
Would the neighbors smell the corpse before the cat ate my face?
I used to floss the albatross like Daddy Kane with the chain
I'm trying to jettison the ballast with the hazardous waste
The kid is comfortably numb, routine a tedious crutch
Steep in a self-imposed Stockholm and Lima in flux
Maybe an occupation popular with demons and ducks
Made any mingling akin to being seasoned and stuffed
It's a theatre of jumping jellyfish, jealous little sycophants
Miserable and flimsy from the skippies to the pissy pants
Each one separately convinced
They're sketching with Da Vinci's hands
Delusion turned the communication to prison camp
You fucking dorks ain't a threat to the cause
There ain't a lesson we can learn from the ostensibly lost
I think it's funny when defendants from identical haunts
Step out the tempest, a measure of what the spectrum involves

Maybe no one cares, party over here, I'll be over there

Don't need no help, all by myself

I used to hang around with rappers at the root of the scene
It meant a lot to feel the fugitive community breathe
Maybe to sentimentalize is to be truly naive
I know some shit about your heroes that you wouldn't believe
I think we're all a bunch of weirdos on a quest to belong
The songs are echolocation up in impregnable fog
That's why it's odd to see a pile of imperfections and flaws
Ascend a pedestal to patronize the rest of the cogs
In a mess of obnoxious fantasy, posturing and pageantry
I ain't even mad, I'm impressed, shit it's baffling
God almighty, chop an ivory tower to piano keys
Play your own dirge on the way to surfing maggot beach
You fuckin' dorks ain't a source of the art
You can't be cooler than the corners
Where you source all your parts
The poker-faced, all it takes a couple sordid remarks
We let the manticore out, We make the sorcery bark

Life is so unfair, party over here, I'll be over there

Don't need no help, all by myself

I view the rattling of sabers like a show to expose
Insecurities exploding in emotional code
When braggadocio to go from mostly jokey to gross
Corrode a homie 'til his probity is notably ghost
Before the hobby was a jobby was a miniature hell
You would wobble round your momma like an infant gazelle
The disillusionment has truly been a difficult pill
But you as anything menacing is a difficult sell
In a whistle and bell-o-rama
Black mollies that dress up like piranha
It's not even compelling melodrama
It's a comedy, somebody wanna shop you as a saga
I'm very voluntarily persona non grata
You fuckin' dorks ain't the leaders we need
This ain't the medium for divas out to weasel and breed
I'm offin' coffee with the paupers over tea with the queen
Don't make him show the regency what disobedient means

Heavy load to bear, party over here, I'll be over there

Hey warm cider, barn full of spiders
Orange moon, starry night, particle exciters
In a pageant rivaled only by the origin of fire
Now add an organism from alternative environs
A dozen pair of cartoon eyes in a thicket
To see a neophyte get sliced into ribbons
I'm here to pick lice off each other and assimilate
Duck a suit, troubleshoot his moody user interface
True and suckerproof, grew to fully disengage
Float his only vanishing point away from the picture plane
Go to where the radio trails off
And people catch rabies on the way to their mailbox
Under a sideways rain cornering the briar
Still pull a broad sword from a hoarded synthesizer
Nap in a hole in a tree
Cat leaving voles at my feet
Talking Master P, memory foam everything
Jettison the rest and roulette us a new trajectory
Spinal Tap 11, tapping resin out the evergreen
Designated dark horse, headless independently
Sidewalks end with ponds and frog eggs
Buried bones, and his very own blurry sasquatch vids
Led like field ants to a hot lens
8 o'clock kittens vs cobwebs, fight!

Maps won't work here

Ice over bittersweet nightshade
Antlers rise from his migraine
Shred or die, life's strange
How do you identify?
New with the matutinal or peckish with the vespertine
Me, I'm pretty useless
Til the roof is painted Gemini, then set him free
Eat his own body weight in genocide
Came back a decorated dog of war
Who wants more though he currently stuck in the dog door
Additionally, dog isn't even his final form
Just a period, between greenhorn and Hyperion
Peer into the eye of a primordial experience
Portamento warriors in unforgiving wilderness
Borderline ethereal, Noah's Arc room tone
Add a little up high down low too slow
Found acquaintances a pain to babysit
So he gave away his shit and gave 'em all the slip
Now pets hit the ceiling when the wind blows
Fish float belly up songbirds crash into windows
Swizzle apple cider vinegar and dish soap
Suicide flies take dips in the kill zone
Still shuffle thru a stack of old photos
Taken before the varicose verified Chronos
I dunno it feels weird
I'd rather feed an apple to a deer

I might've heard something in the walls
Could've been voices
Could've been claws
Coulda been the rebel yell of something more evolved
Pounding on the front door and standing on the lawn like
"Wadup"

Ain't shit

Die already
None defy the one-man walled city
Stone made flesh, veins etched in his hands
88 stance draped in invasive plants
And rain dance unsafely, brace for the supercell
Mutiny or footage for your blooper reel, who can tell
Pours hot tar from the top of the barn
Necktie on his head, condor on his arm
Dog Star in a jar, bordering unsustainable
Mea culpa, mea culpa, maybe I should pray occult
Systematic Catholic or sigil of the Baphomet unraveling
Either way his ID show a snake and skull
Always been a private dude who couldn't keep a tally
Of which lies he told who
Dye his hair, shave, change names and his lazy drawl
Soon enough I will estrange you all
I get ghost

On Dasher
Half-dead carolers deck a hall, wreck a whole advent calendar
Brother on speakerphone lurking at the Burgerville
Bathrobe hammer toes murdering the curb appeal
Would I be returning or forsaken with the craven and
Carnivourous vegetation that take him for his Steak-umms
I dunno I gotta think about it
Truthfully I don't know which makes me a bigger coward
Either stomach all the hubris, cash in his two cents
Loose lips locked up over a chewed Eucharist
Or, maybe re-appropriate the energy
Holed up, passing the poultry to Hecate
Bullheaded burn out fled his own pedigree
And never better, never would've met your Heaven anyway
Anyway, merry merry go make soup out of bones
Just know when the room go cold
I'm a ghost

G-H-O-S-T
Ghost ghost ghost
He's ghost

Flea comb, exorcism and de-worming
Fitted for a curse and a crown of birds circling
Search party falling forward unthwarted
Meet him at the crossroads drawn and quartered
For a master of puppets, how sad are his cupboards
Non-dairy creamers, can of last supper
And a runneth over cup full of black tap water
Its a marvel of privacy over pack hunter
Raspberry jelly on his Jesus toast
And turn heather gray sweats into Easter clothes
With no immediately measurable crimewave ice-age
Christ children still skin a cat sideways
I don't pick teams or administer bans
I'm in the creek with a pick and a pan, it go
Forcibly ejected or a voluntary death scene
Tell 'em what the out-of-order blinking EMF mean
Ghost

Yep
Steps up to the plate
Little brother, little league
'87 he was 8
Rookie season for the skinny slugger
Newly out of t-ball
Pit against a pitcher with a ripper you could eat off
Church, then a grip of loons run to 3rd first
Granny yelling "Go Cubs!", nose in her word-search
Seen milfs like apes on a monolithic bleacher
Into advocating war and peace in lieu of sport and leisure
"Hi Peggie!"
I was 10, chewing on a Sweet Tart
Little brother, left field, queen's guard
Mean arm, knees bent
2 out, 2 on bags
When I caught him staring down at something moving thru the grass
Hold up
Tagged runner and the whole cast rotate
Not before he could identify the culprit
Granny yelling, "Go Cubs!"
Graham yelling, "Gopher!"
New left fielder give a fuck about a homer
Got a homie, little rodent, head and shoulders out his hovel
No baseball in the bubble
Ruh-roh
Parents thought it adorable
The players followed suit
Inning crawling to a close
Head coach not amused
Coach seeing red
Coach on the diamond dragging 27 inches of aluminum behind him
When he transverse 3rd, the families turn nervous
The following is a transcript of man vs. vermin
Here we go
Man stands out by a hole
Pest pops up to patrol
Man plays live Whack-a-Mole
In a scene that would try every child as adults
Woah
Pallbearer with a ball mit
Thrown over the fence
Coach hit the bench
Both teams lose
"Good game, good game"
Granny yelling "Go Cubs!", Cubs ain't playing

My little brother is a funny dude
A lot of funny shit happened to him
My other brother pretty funny too
Ain't seen him in a minute though

Just in case of rough waters, I want to put one up for my brothers
Just in case of rough waters, I want to put one up for my brothers

Yep
Not a part of the machine
Big brother, big idea, '90, 16
Neubaten tee, plaid flannel-laden adolescent art kid
Tony Hawk hair, Skinny Puppy denim
And a record player vomiting Alien Sex Fiend
Peel sessions in a Christian home for field testing
It's real youth in the palm of your hand
When your mom thinks Satan is involved in a band
We were buried in the Village Voice
Checking who was playing where
Pulled his head up out the paper, pushing out a single tear
Five words, like a beacon of light in the mist:
"Ministry live at the Ritz"
It was Christ has risen to Chris
3 loaves, 2 fish
Miracle of mechanized loops on 2-inch
Coming to a theater he would be there in the flesh
Moms didn't say "No," but she didn't say "Yes"
Cop tickets, ah the plot thickens
Countdown to ultimate concert experience
Ma still wary
"...and why are they called Ministry?! Are they a cult?!..."
Maybe she would properly investigate
Bought a mag with an Al Jourgensen interview
Read a couple sentences, glanced at a pic or two or three
That's all, no fair trial
Simply, "You will not be going to the show and that's final!"
What occurred next were the top of the lungs of a son who unjustly had lost what he loved
In a moment that would transcend anger to high art
Said, "This is something I am willing to die for!"
Can you even imagine a death in the fam from industrial fandom?
Anyway, no body count no concert and Chris kicked rocks in his mismatched Converse

My older brother is a funny dude
A lot of funny shit happened to him
We hadn't spoken in a couple moons
I called him last night
"How you doing?"

Just in case of rough waters, I want to put one up for my brothers
Just in case of rough waters, I want to put one up for my brothers

Been a bit since Mu died
Been a lot more loss in the wake
I recall thinking some day someone's gonna say it's all from the same cause and effect
And I just couldn't fathom
Blaming a whole new page on a made-up chain reaction
Each claim individual peaks and pockets
Pains and a slew of unique nuances
Nahmean?
When you wake up 8 years non-responsive
It's a lot to process
Gone from a happier jack-in-the-box
To a package of clogged up chakras
Oh shazbat
Not the "ever after" he wanted from the "once upon a time"
Dot, dot, dot
Once upon a time he was so much more than a punchline for his own potshots
Ah, Watch the Impossible Kid
Everything that he touch turns promptly to shit
If I zoom on out I can finally admit
It's all been a blur since Mu got sick
None of the subsequent years stood a chance
Whether you his moms or his mans
Whether you his pops or his girl
I was poison, heart full of canines, head full of voices
Whole life trying to quiet 'em down
Like a suicide king with a knife in his crown
Hounds at bay, but they just won't stay
True friendship in a tugboat way
A go dark in the face of the fucked, when the fucked was a friend I was basically done
Into the woods go his alien tongue
It was that or a textbook faking of funk
And I can't
Here go the hindsight
8 years been one long blindside
I could pinpoint 7 more turns that occurred cuz he never really healed from the first
Oh what a world
Any hack is a myth, any dap is a joke
Any map is a trick, any graph is a hoax
Ease on down, I'm burning up, I'm bleeding out
Knowing ain't half the battle
That's a bullshit quip written by some asshole
You can own what you are
And still sit around stoned in your car
Not doing shit, halfway to nill
Cranky and waiting for a boss key and hat full of bills
Get out the car, Aes

My first name is a random set of numbers and letters
And other alphanumerics that changes hourly forever
My last name, a thousand vowels fading down a sinkhole
To a susurrus, couldn't just be John Doe or Bingo
My address a made-up language written out in living glyphs
Lifted from demonic literature and religious text
Telephone uncovered by purveyors of the ouija
Then checked against the CBGB women's room graffiti
My social a sudoku, my age is obscure
My in-case-of-emergency is in the daisies chasing birds
Employed by trillionaires with perfect teeth and pores
And people who open doors for the people who open doors
My medical history is a course at SUNY Buffalo
Charlatan psychiatry and troubleshooting undertow
Nervous in the service still, I'm burger meat and purple pills
"Here," "Thank you, we'll call your name," "Sure you will."

Skipped lunch, I'm shrunk

You pack up all your manias, you're sitting in the waiting room
You're dreaming of arcadia, you're feeling like a baby tooth
Awaiting panacea, channeling your inner Beowulf
In purgatory just before you pay up to filet yourself
And others, in the name of help, coal on a conveyor belt
Into ego death alone, no telephone from Gabriel
I'm half a human combin' over home and garden stoned
Gold chains over turtleneck, cigars over cologne
A thousand shitty paintings wrap around the wounded animal
Woo him with the Schubert, he's a future human cannonball
Little fuckers fighting, mother hiding in her Hulu
I'm climbing up the stucco, let's get to the seppuku
Uh-oh, that pretty penny turned the prickly into Benji
If you save up all your winnings
Then you get to count your blessings
I finally crunch the budget up and punch the button
She called my name out and pushed me into an oven

The fuck? I'm shrunk

She says, "I'm not your enemy."
I said, "That sounds like something that my enemy would say
Instead of playing off the chemistry."
She said, "You're being difficult."
I said, "I'm being guarded; you're a quarter mil in debt
I get more guidance from my barber
Look, I'm not good at this, I grew up in a noogie-fest
You built your walls up high
Or say goodbye to all your Cookie Puss
Here's one: every time my telephone buzzes
I see images of hooded riders setting fire to hundreds."
She said, "When you start getting all expressive and symbolic
It's impossible to actualize an honest diagnostic."
I said, "When you start getting all exact and algebraic
I'm reminded it's a racket, not a rehabilitation."
Okay, agree to disagree as grown-ups from opposing clans
Honoring the push and pull, I should have called the Scholomance
Oh well, preservation is a doozie
"Will you be needing another appointment?" – "Absolutely,"
I'm shrunk!

Hobgoblin, shots of hot Strongid
Vaccine queen deem church socks hostage
9 weeks awesome
Hides in a slipper
Look in her eye like she might be a wizard
Cold met a cat lady in a parking lot, she got the heroes of tomorrow in a cardboard box
And probably hoarding 40 more in the corners of Fort Knox
Swap 20 on the spot and cop the warlock
Back at the haunt, found god in the hamper
Briefs on her head playing Walking With a Panther
Good around misery and golden era samplers
Jeopardy and Wheel at the heels of her handlers
Bet, more than a pet to worship, it's an MD recommended sense of purpose
Here to bat around keys and the means to euphoria
Soon to be hailed, the greatest of all warriors

Hey Kirby
What you doing Kirby
What you doing there
(I'm not takin' shorts)
Hey Kirby
What you doing Kirby
Why'd you eat that leaf

Homie don't fetch, only woke to stretch
Under a thought bubble rich with bowls of goldfish
Skittish in the company of stranger danger
Otherwise, chase draw strings, tails and lasers
In a steel cage match with a maze of cables
Brazen, game-face based on Azazel
Oversized ears up, puke in the Meow Mix
Shred a pair of earbuds, remedy his cowlick
[slurp]: Thanks Kirbs, looking like a milli
Keep an old man sharp, keep a cold Chantilly
Spun plum dizzy in a frisky moment
Never lands on her feet though, I think she's broken
Mouser in training, nap on the toaster
Decorate her cubicle with dogs playing poker
15 years taking prescriptions
Now a shrink like, "Ionno, maybe get a kitten"

Hey Kirby
What you doing Kirby
What you doing there

Dum-diggy, bump Biggie
Til the landlady holler, "Get a haircut, hippie"
The death knell generator entertain a fresh kill
Breath quelled dressed like a bloated sack of dead cells
Shedding, purple tape, purple 'hawk, ape
A single flower through the permafrost
Pick himself and learn to walk, in furry pants
War paint, circling a duralog
Boar face, devil by his side like a service dog
Schlock purist, watch the block burneth
One o'clock prophets in the parking lot at Perkins
The perfect politicians 30 clicks outside of Sturgis
Doggie bag doctors, military deserters
Who still shop surplus and can't hold jobs
I look like I'm wearing a ghillie suit when I'm not
Roll out ghost of Camu on the pegs
Might pedal by the police
Tuff with two F's

Ah fuck that shit look
Can't tell if I'm a little withdrawn
Or dead dog sent to quote/unquote "live on a farm"
The coke bottles tint film noir
Tripping out the milk bar
Poison horchata cup
Milf in the Zip Car
6 arms, 6 hand-styles like ships on scrimshaw
Part Def Jam part Dischord
My wig-picker threw me out of her office
Had to cold turkey 'benzos, summer was awesome
Onion of 'bensis
Summer was awesome
Got brats on the grill
Wormwood in the cauldron
Horse hoof in the dog's mouth
Cholera in the well
Make money periodically vomiting on himself
I read Nat Geo, craft and crack geodes
Lift party hats out of Craft Depot
Unleaded liar blood pumped through his neck
Came down from the mountain
Tuff with 2 F's

TUFF
TUFF

(What's so funny?
You, what are you laughing at?
I said what are you laughing at?)

Before a player ever met his omega
They were effectively reducing his behavior into data
With plans to build a dais where the
People grow potatoes and cabbage
Don't make him raise the gate between the bettas
In a spectacle displaying the nature of strange neighbors
I paint caves 'til the rage campaign tapers
And show a new crop how he used to moonwalk
Out of breath like a 7-day old balloon dog
I still hang band posters and buy black-lights
Crib decorated like a dorm room at Brandeis
Still pretend I'm gonna build another half-pipe
Nevermind the Ford-era christening and pants size
Man, who could've guessed the future of abominable imagery
Would also share a birthday with Kenny G? None
The 99 cent 2 cents keeps 2 arms folded
Tuff with 2 F's

Yeah, let's do it like that

Unh I pay a guy to lean over steepled fingers
And convince me to pay him for his teas and tinctures
The string cheese dinner kid speak Cheech wizard
For the gone like Gossamer under number 3 clippers
Free, forged in various pulp channels
Even his prize horse rides a wolf into battle
Even his blood and body couldn't pick him out a line up
Or his name off the paper
It's Aes pronounced "Why Us?!"
First learned the high art of eyeing a mark
Buying nickels for a dime at the park
I learn to rhyme in New York
I learned to breathe underwater
I learned to walk with a ghost
Adidas reeking of sulfur
A chauffeur cemetery funk
When home is a bleeding ulcer
Everything you ever stood up for is keeling over
Moonset beautifying
Cartoon death catfish on the Foreman
Tuff with 2 F's
Yeah

My spirit animal comes with a pretzel bun
Troll of the treadmill
Record on the Kessel Run (allegedly)
Edgy from elevenses to Megabucks
Techies with the treble down
This is how we level up
Dead meat, time travel, pressure, and disease
As ushered out of two fingers pecking at the keys
The coping mechanism in his LMNOP's
Went from healthy to unhealthy to a hell he never leaves
Cineplex Jesus, curse at the curly fries
Mulling over Chuck D telling me, "Diversify"
I'm at the Supercuts soupin' up the wardrobe
Forecast looking like Ganesh on four phones
"Hello, hello, hello, hello"
Base camp, space camp
Bass in your face fuck, brace for the rain dance
Back in the back of the classroom
After a magical nap in a vacuum

Act natural, whatever that means for you
Whatever that means for you
Whatever that means for you
(Superfresh)

Before climbing douchebag mountain, I was skate or die
Started eating kale and came to terms with my lazy eye
Putting on the yoga lady, cutting off The Cable Guy
Whistle while you're waiting for your condition to stabilize
AV cables everywhere, every piece of vinyl scratched
Mentholated Tiger Balm, Aleve with the arthritis cap
Irons and the niacin, iron Quiet Riot mask
Unabashed privacy expanding into simulcast
40 winks, never the same adventure
Refreshing, or the single longest exorcism ever
In the end, you gotta wonder if it's even worth the effort
No stairways into Heaven, you can step into the Escher
Some people have mistaken my allegiance for a weakness
It fucked me up for eons, I wished I was a theist
The type to fake his death then forget he faked his death
Show up on TV, in the crowd at the AVNs, like...

Sometimes I feel my heart putrefying inside my body
From diary of dark to piety in the Ponzi
On my better days they mingle and walk off into the poppy
On my worst, the work is overshadowed by the monte
Had to buy some clothes that fit me
And pretend I like agave
With a promise to his congress not to compromise the motley in him
Maybe I should kinda sorta move to Mars
I'm feeling kinda done, too many moving parts
The piss-poor vision is 40 percent floaters
The kitchen is a chorus of glorious leftovers
The friends you confessed all the dark shit to
Had weaponized the information before we could send roses
And they want a little pearl on how he got to where he at
I can't remember where I am, I feel it's probably a trap
Balk with the lawless, cough in his notes
Walk on even when the walls hug his coat

Act natural, whatever that means for you
Whatever that means for you
Whatever that means for you
(Superfresh)

Alex up the street called, said he saw a bobcat
Keep the pets inside, notify your contacts

New Salem
Brave new voodoo
Wave a witch hammer in a haven for the woo woo
I'm paper china dinner, mostly picking at my stitches
The bloody hair, bad code, bunny ears, dad jokes
Bitch about Lamictal to whichever vixen listen
The skin rash, the schism, a million rash decisions
In truth, he had a capital T terrible 2 days
That chewed his plumage to the root
And proved a prequel to malaise
A feud he knew was brewing blew up in his face
He'd been replaying the scenario for days
With the variables replaced
Meh
Loser in the sky with more diamonds than the carpet from the Shining
Part riot, part Orion
We jarred a lot of lightning up
Shook a turkey leg or 10
Maybe we deserve a day of rest
Not to mention...

Alex up the street called, said he saw a bobcat
Check your trash can lids, notify your comrades
I said, "I'll take first watch"
1 AM defend the whole block
(1 A M)

The coyotes, summon the ghosts of blown diodes
Open and moving like a luchador with no eyeholes
Fried while the pipes froze, life goes Lovecraft
Christ-pose, sitting on invisible hubcaps, up
Call Alex back, daggers in the basil patch
Tell him maybe less badminton more Scrabble Dash
Less Jarts more Rummikub
Whatever keep the scallywags wrapped up in the subterfuge
Gussied up, guarded, and wearing the same armor as the night he argued 'til he dapped his mans up at departures
I could drive into a lake of fire
Pay the piper COD
Aware the pot and kettle shop a little toxin equally at least
It's probably more the kid than the kid
Either way a vital widget in the system is sick
A sea of symptoms in the hinges hit the room all at once
All I can do is plug the roof with my gum
For now I gotta...

Call Alex back, coyotes in the castle grass
Tell him, "Maybe less freeze tag, more hack-n-slash"
I said, "I'll take first watch"
1 AM defend the whole block
(1 A M)

So a third party, who is incidentally not Alex
Seen a black bear catawampus by the college campus
Soon the safety propaganda clamps breeds on leashes
No compost, bird seed out of feeders
Make a lot of noise when you frolic under the ether
Keep a hand on the pepper spray
Sneakers on the detour
They're more scared of you than you them
Although, one of us chews limbs, and one has 2 chins
Leave a couple messages, vomit a couple dollar bills
Guilty in the window romanticizing the potters field
Not sorry, but I never really was a leader
Found money in the speaker, bought lower Manhattan pizza
You meet a few exceedingly forsaken
Sit around the cooler refusing domestication
Then a couple decades pass and you can't even find the wavelength you was on when you was running 1 AM
By the way...

A third party, who was incidentally not Alex
Seen a bear put a thousand chickens in a pot with carrots
I said, "I'll take first watch"
1 AM defend the whole block

Found nothing but the feathers and the skull
On the porch like a present with a bow
Denizen of black earth, gutted and uncoupled from the patchwork
Buried by a 7 year cherub in the backyard
Epitaph and all
Disciple of the cycles and sciences, of birth into fertilized hyacinth
Life into vitamins, invited up to cypresses
A testament to moxie and the miracle of lifelessness
It's tricky when you'd rather rot into the soil as a nutrient
Than navigate this mortal coil in human skin, dig?
The nuances of putrefying jelly hit the levee
When those feathers are a cancer in your bestie
And I pick a ginger gold as fed by a drunken uncle
One from a customer pumping that Sumner blood work
Memitim ascending, settling any high scores
40 meters up with the heart of a high dive horse

Paint "No Rules" on the water tower
(Impossible, impossible)

(Hold the fuck up
Who is you talking to?
Cause ain't nobody talking to you
You can't do a motherfucking thing)

I told my ex in '97 I was falling on my weapon
Ripped the phone up out the wall
The po' would drag me from my bedroom
An embarrassing ordeal involving hospitals and questions
And the kind of doctors who use words like "cognitive" and "spectrum"
While explaining why you're selfish to romanticize a ruse
In which unruly roots pull you to Lucifer by your shoes I mean, it isn't perfect but don't misconstrue the purpose
Any urge is indiscernible from community service to the kiddo
Plus she'd make a beautiful widow
But that's an altruistic ticket to a room with no windows
Hmm you'd think he would've learned back in the 80s
When they pulled him out of class over concerns about his safety
But he didn't, it wasn't cause he doesn't get the message
More he doesn't judge a man by how honorable his death is
On a scale you made up anyway
Half past out to pasture
Whether clapped or batteries in backwards

(Check this shit out here
Don't be trying to come all for me
Cause you is not all of that with your fucked up haircut)

I had a pet lizard, he never got an obit
Fed him crickets, it was dead a fucking month before I noticed
An older me would note that whether disposable goldfish
Or theist, we certainly become the earth as equals, in a circle
Unique until the spirit isn't willing
While the flesh is still a staple of the labor force and whistling
It's roadkill evoking emotion his own totem don't
That's a reality you evade or grow to own
Social code broke and a hierarchy to gasp at
Black labs over wack dads on the admat
Tabby over parasite, bats at the parish
A civil war becoming of ungovernable atoms
I'm born from the guts of stars and black tar pits
Iron Maiden denim paint the devil under grawlix
Crawls out a clawed coffin to huff and puff
Somewhere in between the dust and dust

Spoilers, the non bon-voyage
Stock weaponry and soylents and whatever stop the voices
Colossal paranoias out to author an abrasive lore
About how war paint won't assure you ain't a painted whore, baby
No ground wires, all jaw froth
Mouth-breathing outliers climb out of mothballs
Wrung stones unsung and alone
Known to run up in the unknown, "honey I'm home"
I push a bucket of bolts, assorted death in his wake
I take the hand off the thief, I take the head off a snake
Approach a pen like revolution's just a sentence away
'Til then he's documenting cops and watching Heaven decay
It's not a gentleman's game it's a generation braced accordingly
Who know the differences between the cozy and the quarantine
Yes y'all the crestfallen careworn
Air horn, air horn, air horn, air horn

These awful winds
Those grinding gears
This pile of bones
That's why I'm here
Wild frontier
(Come on)

These violent drums
Those primal fears
This pool of mud
That's why I'm here
W-w-w-w-wild frontier

That's impossible, body still warm
Scavengers already obsessively knocking on his molecules
I'm catatonic, fat, and outta rocket-fuel and ramen
Not a dollar, watching Rocky 2 in Donatello boxers
At some hot-as-hell motel in what's supposed to be his Shangri-La
More akin to angry mobs with anchor tats and mangey dogs in vacant lots
Traded any semblance of consistency to play the odds
Not even a baby doll to change his gauze
Not even a hideaway to hide up in
A side effect of sliding environment to environment
Driving isn't simply when the tires spin, try again
Departures and arrivals aren't only time and mileage
Try again again, a raider break off from the phalanx
And never look back, never cook crack, K - thanks, bye
New York in the rear view then peel
Out, 'til he found New York in the windshield

These cursed dogs
Those flying spears
This rancid food
That's why I'm here
Wild frontier
(Come on)

These fleeting hopes
Those vital prayers
This bag of cash
That's why I'm here
W-w-w-w-wild frontier

This was never an effective way to rally insurgents
Or really even the occupation of a rational person
When you write about seclusion and some buyers finally tune in
You get frightened finding happiness can drive away the movement
In a jiffy, just eat your food and keep the future iffy
That fruition's for the viewers who need a loser to pity
Plus an underlying message of a greater disconnection
God forbid he try to live or gain momentum
Mend or pay his penance
You'd rather see him eat a bowl of mouse traps
Surf a thousand couches
Take a jagged little down the hatch
Chowderheads
I know you love the way the failure flounder
Maybe I could be your daily downer
If his brain left his body and was headed for the door
Would you take it in and help it find its way into a jar?
No? fuck it, let him hop around a maze
We can see who's really lost when the schadenfreude fades

These churning seas
Those quiet sneers
This box of parts
That's why I'm here
Wild frontier
(Come on)

These creepy friends
Those dicey dares
This perfect dark
That's why I'm here
W-w-w-w wild frontier

The dirty dishes are becoming self-aware
Even the roaches like "I wouldn't raise my children here"
Simple syrup in his veins, dirty nails, lizard brain
Eyes wide, spine like a saltlick in pissing rain (pssss)
ASR Schroder split the rent with ghosts and bacterial cultures
Might track poltergeists prints through his Folgers, gross
Home is where the unholy sojourn
Dead sea bath tub
Never mind his welfare
Party at the penthouse carpeted in pet hair
Fridge full of black deli meat and dead air
Sill prefer it to the overbearing lens flare
And death stare Plinko and an at risk ego
System, egos over peace, love, and wisdom
Police shooting everything
Media's a fuck show
Religion is a scapegoat for cut-throats
Fuck no

I ain't going out there, man
I don't trust no one out there, man
You don't even know what's out there, man
Man

Paranoia voyeur awake in the haunted crawl space
Hoodie up, gaunt face down, taut draw strings
Sprawl over the cookie cut, a mutt of all things
All mange, all dogs of war evolve strange
Nose in the feed trough, curds in his coffee
Tend to his cough and uncontrollable frothing
Spawn of the awful, play the wall softly, hunt alone
Hum his own swan song off-key

Hate himself like a snake with two heads
The new flesh-eater co, eat a whole food web
Spoon fed stupefying death to a zoom lens
Definitely never leave a neck where the noose ends
Ever, follow what the rap hands pantomime
Slit throats, hang men, and bellyachers atomized
Jam at the party with the vamps and the carnies
He the upper hand, one man skeleton army

Lightning struck that man two times
Brushed off his coat that man’s too alive
Slack jaw, chew a face off no bath salts
No crabs only fatten’d up pack wolves
Tracking, cro-mags batten down hatches
Not a sap, not a scratch on the crash test
Ashes to ashes, catch the odd sonnet
What more can I say, Top Ramen

Cats had better learn to do the worm before sixth grade
Same age, fix your man's fade and make a mask out a pig face
Cats had better not leave they fitted on the 6 train
Cats had better gimme back my Mr. Magic mixtape
Meditate and get a bit creative with the ramen brick
Cats had better fetch the kid a soda pop and ottoman
Cats had better beeline to the monolith
Cats had better never doubt the dollar bin
AKA the promised land

Cats had better learn to recognize a po in plain clothes
Cats had better not graduate to what they hate most
Cats had better shout "aight" when Doug E. flip the "ayo"
Better yet take notes on the whole stage show, K?
Cats had better drink up all they Ovaltine
And recognize the flow is more important than the smoke machine
Cats had better learn a thing or two about diplomacy
Cats had better cool it with the “Holy Moses woe is me…”

Cats had better name they horsey Paul Revere
And wear a smoking jacket when attempting to dramatically about face in they office chair
Cats had better not back-up off the triple dog dare
Cats had better stop romanticizing the crosshairs
Aw yeah, cats had better save me a jelly-filled
Cats had better greet me with the theme song from Benny Hill
Draw an arrow through the head of every prez on every bill
Cats had better keep they head and arms inside the ferris wheel

Hit it!
This is when you line your little bastards up
Set aside a muster point then run and get your candle snuffed
Suckers get abducted by a clustering of animus
Where street performers only juggle cutlery and cannonballs
Muscle through the analog, a part of something heavenly
Rubber duckies in a row and Tetris-ing, it's therapy
Raiders of the multiverse in bumper cars that don't reverse
Make a move, maybe you should grow out of your floaties first

Speakers of an unknown dialect
Each breath comes with it’s own environment
You lack the minerals and vitamins
Treat hacks like flies to the spider-web
Don’t ever count the kid out…
Don’t ever count the kid out…
Don’t ever count the kid out…
Don’t ever count the kid out…

I was on stilts trying to build with angels
You were crying over spills at the children's table
There there, never been a shill for the shameful
He mainly, chills, laying bricks on his Grayskull
Even if it kills him, pissed off, quit the pills
I don't sip what the system sells
I'm in the distance, tied to a cartoon rocket
Death proof, dressed like an art school project
Walk on the wild side, smile and a swamp hat
Low-fi pro invoke trial by combat
Ah, mile-high Aes say grace over Wattstax
Aim for the gong or the conman
I’m an odd one, I’m a crazy 8
Call top bunk, do the stanky leg
Gather ‘round and watch a rabble rouser radiate
Radio invaders breaking atoms at the Steak and Shake

My dude
I woke a million miles away from my original muse
The very soil on which he learned to conquer Mario 3
Build a fire, and out-maneuver any mark of the beast
I speak an alien argot, New York amass in his tongue
The vibe is basically martian, they smell the Jack in his blood
I ain't the kind that use New York as a crutch, I use the force of the funk
Enjoy the work and earn my portion of mush
On a tour of the wild frontier, lying awake
I tell myself it's all to broaden my societal take
And while I sorta still believe it I'd be lying if I
Didn't admit I’d like to curl up on Long Island and die
It's not a science, nomads crash land antsy
Whether badlands or in back of the Plaid Pantry
Stick a flag in, the claim don't fade, find shelter and await old age
It feels so strange

I'm not complaining though
That's the way the daisy grow
We hide away and try to make
The best of what's available
My older homies think I'm kinda sorta schizo
I feel the same of y’all, but don't consider it a issue
We can openly embrace it or be trained to mostly tiptoe
Where shame becomes a staple in the nature of the crypto
That's a baseball through your window, a roach up in your shawarma
I know it sounds strange but, strange beats normal

I step in the arena bumping Step in the Arena
Green wayfarers, no gray hair, it's a patina
Don't play fair, you could tell by how he share his pizza
The 60/40 special from a porky Ebeneezer
Reppin’ La Isla Bonita, brace for the brain rot
Four eyes, corners like a marble in a maze box
Set your phasers, obey or catch the vapors
My 1,2, unscrew a player from his trainers

Yapple Dapple, rappers like crabs in a barrel
Get trapped and blanched and snap crackled
I’m Ginsberg interning at the Magic Castle
I’m Bob Ross, happy accidents and rad afro
Back and a tad wacko in laughably bad graphics
The class act travel in batches of Mad Max’s
And savages who still haven’t changed out of their pajamas
Luckily I never show up on your cameras, It’s bananas

Old school, new school, no school
These bass lines ain't raise no fool
Aes AWOL outta homeroom
Heads up, show up in the throne room
Hoping for a breadcrumb, throw up in the show room
Wait show ‘em how the rogue do
March to his own with the clone-proof
Songbirds perched on my finger at the window
Admittedly the rest of my life is a fucking shit-show

Is it fighting words or myna birds?
Piracy or rattling?
A lionheart or Life Alert?
I don't support a media that fetishize the wealthy 'cause it's weird
I'm here to help contextualize the Veldt to a room of terrible cadets who dress like Mr. Belding
I turn 'em into messengers rebelling, it's compelling
The cavalcade approach on the heels of obscene evil
It's easel is meteoric, it's beanie is Steve Zissou

Oddworld bogmen
Slog through toxins
Groggy
Squash all goblins
Promptly
Fruit of loom, relocating stickers on his Rubik's Cube
Wildlife showing signs of ruined doom
For you and you and you and you
Shoes made of wah-wah pedals
That turn a walk to the Wawa, the gods and devils
I'm at the table breaking bread with both the wicked and the righteous
It's hard to tell the difference through a history of violence

Keep code fluent
Chief flow mutant
The kid sits still 'til a tree grow through him
East coast, eat slow, throwing pizza crust at pigeons
After dinner hit a visa with two Dobermans like Higgins
I'm looking for a mystery bigger than me to remedy
Regardless of its place in the greater collective memory
I'm pissed at every terrifying truck stop in the country
I'll piss upon your pick-up truck for absolutely nothing

I only move aside for the sun
I only move aside for the sun
I don't really move aside that much
Nah mean?
Nah mean?
And I'm not a big fan of the checkin'
Check it

All grown stuff
Long road no fluff
Piece of work
Eat the turn buckle like a roast duck
Post punk
Played it back
Raider of the rations
Blacksmith: forge Coltrane out of Klaxons
Zap!
The riddle wriggle on about the residue
A social advocate, a Black Phillip at the petting zoo
Run ragged til the blood magic pretzel you
Rag tag plasmid owners clashing over devil's food
(Cake)
These are the breaks that make the embers blue
I can't wake up without a lake of fire to step into
I can't wake up without a battle scene to emulate
I'm in the kitchen repositioning the trebuchets
Top row swan dive
Aim for the ballyhoo
Bonzai!
Certain death hangs from a parachute
My bows and arrows like two lovers
Underneath the Paris moon
They been together since the bounty hunt
This afternoon, and K-I-S-S-I-N-G
Eyes on his rivalries
Look at all these wonderful prizes inside his diaries
I write about delirium and disappearing devils
Then frame it with a margin of the most feared symbols
And a shitty drawing of me playing Guns n' Roses pinball
People peeking in my window like they might just wear my skin home
I walk like a D-Day sim
You walk like a de-veined shrimp
Simp!

Hated myself since before it was cool
Faced death like an orphan of gruel
Pardon the drool
Four eyes, palm croakies, ominous blueprints
And a peace sign middle going "I'm With Stupid"
Top stool, drop the pontoon
La Schmoove, Don clobber the chronically obtuse
Put down the telephone around a crew and double back
Summoning a storm from the pulpit of Farmer's Almanac cleanly
Separate the chukkas from the bucket hat
Hold still, gold fillings jump into his duffel bag
Shift, gotta shave for the minions
Started out simian, graduated ophidian
Fitting in as a fool's heir and unworthy to emulate
I don't care, I never really felt cool anyway
Back in the cave for safekeeping
In the company of Lorna Doone and polyphasic sleeping

I anchor in the bottleneck
Double-knotted lobster bib
Satan spawn, game on, flings to the aqua-net
Prickly disposition from the mission statement riddled with the crippling misdirection of a million jaded middles
Pretending to be different than the businesses they meddle in
Until the whistleblowers separate the skin and skeleton
Underneath the hood is all pedestrian, essentially
Thespianisms threaded into the documentary, I mean
What a ruse, ever-winning etiquette
Allegiances have come unglued, tender feet are cherrypicked
Little lambs sure to go like everywhere that Mary went
Lions get therapy and branded as heretics
Single tear, Aes play Taps on the theremin terribly
Serenade the death of transparency
Now we'll ride out out cloaked with no cronies
Watching alphas grow up into bronies
(Oh, geeze)

Yeah, time to make the donuts
Eat, drink, annihilate the bogus
Wide awake and snarling
The dark wings opening on my darling
I speak in holy code and keep the rodeo alarming, homie
Old eyes parrot a roach that won't die
Slow night spirit looking for a hive to ghost ride
Over the river through the woods
I eat the bread I spoon the mush
Keep it dirty, we prefer misshapen over cookie cut
My office hours are noon for thirty seconds
Then it's off into the tempest for berries and buried treasures
Trade tall tales with lepers and lost dogs
Swing claws at pinatas and the shapes of all y'alls
Hey, the new voice of a defective species
Reflect from the cheap seats
Checking his cheat sheets
Eat a raw horse heart
Yum, yum, four stars
At the fork is a forfeit of a foreign march

I'm covered in that grit
Covered in that sludge
Covered in that muck
Covered in that mud
See I'm covered in that sweat
Covered in that blood
Got covered in that stuck
Covered in that mud

My search history ain't glamour and glitz
More ramp plans and "Can a man be a witch?"
One Stan Smith five toes curled in the sand
Free a bird from a cage
Feed a squirrel from his hand
Greet a world with the rhyme face
Don't play fair I'm all
Eyes made of coal I'm all
Snakes for hair I'm all
Side-scrolling eye contact over speed chest
Blink once get a king deep sixed
Aes boogie
Brain getting mushy
No brakes still break for a plate full of cookies
How his shoes so clean? He barely house broken
Mold unclean air in our wild moments
Focused overgrown topiary uproot
Rosemary middle fingers poking out the sun roof
Donuts in the parking lot yelling duck duck goose
Fuck drums pull your guts from your jumpsuit, ah

Call me if you need a bum to bring the belching
Or a situation worsened by someone who thinks they're helping
The drums are eatin' healthy, hell he might deploy the garrison
Who rap like hanging out with rappers hadn't turned to parenting

It had. Barrel over everyone you're parroting
He don't need a map to lead a rat into the Paris green
Professionally peeking through the blinds
I will read up on your peeves, I will eat up all your fries

Minister of shit's creek, Ballroom Blitzing
Under cloud cover the color of fresh squid ink
Five dollar milkshake, half raw New York strip steak
Jaguar shark in the fish tank

Yo, my parents still don't understand
How their stoner son could turn a silver tongue into a brand
Hack pulp writer, now their younger in demand
More a pandemic crawling from the guts of the expanse

Twists and turns and turns and twists
When I step into the mall they yell "Burn the witch"
I serve with, wailing spirits and weeping walls
Cave dwellers and whoever looked the least evolved

He freefall through traffic, short a couple hubcaps
Sword high, wore a white tie to the bloodbath
Don Mattingly mustache
Naked lady mudflaps

Hey, I don't need a reason to rebel
I sneak into the club, I ain't leavin' without a pelt
For the people feelin' needlessly beleaguered at the helm
Tryna ease up out the nucleus and bleed into the hills

I'm a, old sea dog sippin' on fizz
My ilk still put skate stickers on the fridge
Ate dinner at the Denny's with a dumbed out coven
In the company of uninvited bloodhounds huffin'

Tough crowd, he the chew the cud king
Aw crud, thing one and two in one thing
None drum up any drama for the Huffy
I ain't even lift a glove up out the pockets of the puffy

Once I don't know frozen food, homie
The acid in my stomach eat bones and hooves
I re-home lone wolves, let em' socialize a little bit
Learn pack policy, turn you all to pick up sticks

Rebel rebel, fuck a precious metal
I'm the dopest gettin' cozy with a pencil and a level
The mostly grown-up Mowgli keep a scepter in the tendril
Here to walk into the light with the excessively disheveled

Shovels on our shoulders, spinning out of the nothingness
Roaches in our honeycombs, nothing in our moneyclips
Bass in our media, spirits in our computers
Sad trombones in our futures, troopers

Clan leaders, sit around canned peaches
Divas who never scanned off-brand Cheez-Its
Lost lambs in a sea of pleasant facial features
Hope you also plan to celebrate the rejects

Even though I know to never let a heckler penetrate the defense
I'm aware there's entertainment in the weakness
I also know I'm fortunate to even be allowed the inconvenience
So don't mistake the floundering for doubting of allegiance

He can doubt his own resilience in the hour of screaming Vizslas(?)
Who distract him from the bounty on his demons
Even if I'm Shakespeare on paper, in person I'm Beavis
Homie they don't make a Jesus that fits into what he preaches

Or walk how he do
Wait 'til it's dark, and walk out the zoo
Halfway to 'who the fuck knows?' by two
Giving you the broke-winged crows' eye view

I wanna eat pizza and burgers all day but I'd get fat
Pizza and burgers all day but I'd get fat
I wanna eat pizza and burgers all day but I'd get fat
Pizza and burgers all day but I'd get fat

Ey, somedays I forget to not get stoned before my therapy
Doctor said it wasn't fatal, mostly just embarassing
Meh, talk about trials of the errant
Every second at the pen is like a fire to the penant

Every breath is alive with a dying message
Letter to the editor inscribed in his weapon
I ain't buyin' what they sellin'
Just might climb into the vellum, tell 'em

I wanna eat pizza and burgers all day but I'd get fat
Pizza and burgers all day but I'd get fat
I wanna eat pizza and burgers all day but I'd get fat
Pizza and burgers all day but I'd get fat

My horse drinks on its own, I ain't gotta do shit
True grit from a coup to tell you "my dude's piff"
Please hold for the high noon kid
Roll dice, move chips, push lice, go big

Key I lose slips, toss foods in the cauldron
Add salt, now you got a nice stew goin'
Protectors of the realm keep a jester at the helm
The bells are like a heckler, the hell is not conjecture, fella

Cold stone wall; Schröder, what's the protocol?
Slow your roll and don't approach the homie during multi-bowl
Don't approach the pokey bowler, pay to fear the finger-tax
Roll his weed for 7 days, I'll let you get the pinky back (maybe)

Pie people climb through the fray
On coals when he walk, on time when he late
Step into the time loop, scan the room for side boob
And slide out, back with the slime in the tide pool

Find that eye of the typhoon, it's my house
All I know is night moves, fried food, and dry mouth
Haiku and magpies dyin' to peck your eyes out
Fly from the argyles to the barbed wire crown

The golden oldies, holy water to the witches
I never heard of water under bridges, what is it?
Wait, I can't pretend to care, I'm busy down in Herald Square
Standing on a soapbox, yellin' out "repent, the end is near!"

The children and their parents, who assure them "yes, that man is weird"
Maybe so, maybe though that doesn't mean death isn't here
It got a little dark there for a second
I'm terrible at parties, I'm wonderful at Tetris

I'm number 1 for anybody down to fudge the metrics
I'm Dumbledore for anybody down to smudge the lenses
I'm MENSA if you down to numb the senses
If none of the above apply, I'm just another dummy in detention

Somewhere between "I hate you all" and hungry for affection
Come jump into the tempest with the lovers and the lepers (suckers)
PSYOPs climb through blind spots
Whilst good vibes get the pine box kibosh

Rock bottom just got deeper
I bump Sun Ra and dodge frogs from the ether
Wear sweatpants every day; are less a problem, more a feature
The posse is bottom feeders and possibly Hot For Teacher

Keep a wolf at the door, bull by the horns, Dewey's on a sword
Keys to the city plus code to the green room
Toothpick throne one a pyramid of cheese cubes
None for you; Sam you can have some; Chris, get it
Lice

Lice is singlehandedly responsible for spearheading
The conservation efforts that would leave the giant panda off the redlist
Revolutionaries in support of all day breakfast
Play the record for your mother she might let you get that Xbox

Unless you're hard of hearing
Unicorns should start appearing
Yetis walk up out the forest
You could score a jar of faeries

Solve world hunger when the bass break chains
Automatic blood, hairy game for anyone in range

Who are they?
Say they name and the pain go away
Outta left field something off center
Skincrawlers make it all better

When I'm on the microphone
Teeth start whitening
Geese lay golden eggs
Seas part entirely
Governments abruptly guarantee the peoples' privacy
And everyday you find your keys before you cannot find your keys

Who could make you shake a flute
See the folk who owe you paper pay you by today at noon
With interest, drums that come with a sense of friendship
Will feed your shitty cat while you vacation in the hamptons

You will be accepted into social scenes and secrets clubs
You will always have hot water when you take your evening tub
You will never know a boat that doesen't know the sea of love
You will find your favorite ever pair of shoes for cheap as fuck

Keep the rats up out the city till the water
Reachin every chorus foreshadow an extra week of summer
Listeners are winning trips to tropical locations
And tickets to the movies and dollars out in vegas
