Hunters with their dogs and deer rifles
Thousands of them line the pavement
Like patient pupae waiting to become worms

The people are dead, but the money keeps talking keep-keeps-keep-keeps talking
The people are dead, but the money keeps talking, keep
Keeps-keep-keeps talking

(Another dark night) Teething I'm marking a beast sheep
Like I walk in front of 39 thieves in a "v"
Smores over warm helvetica brown proper
For the odd God or monster, propped to teleprompter
Wild blue yonder, blue in the face, angel
Blew into the bugles in lieu of the euthanasia
Usually the shooter community chew the corpse
But I see the wolves have already gotten to you and yours
Day of the dead, play the ledge closely
Train a barrel of monkeys to aim at the lowest bogey
Dope the gonzo I've always felt choked socially
Stole the golden fleece with the culture of total nobodies
Earth rised, divided by fighting tribes
All we do is watch 'em waddle back and forth lighting fires
(Money money)
Detonator, wire cutter, pliers
Two cities enter, one is broken up in tiny tiles
And I wonʼt pose arm in the heart of the lionʼs throat
For a photographic token of my primordial growth
You parade around and kill, so damn proud
Like a flatline fetish, had it's feathers fanned out
War taught him symmetry, skipped into it gingerly
Silk worms ping-pong ministry to ministry
Hell's bells every which way the the wind blows
So I bang my head against any wall you can build, go

Another dark night, another not alright
Another bad ritual, more botched surgery
Better follow the bread crumbs back in fact, urgently
Or waddle through this section where the natives feel "murdery"
Vicinity wander, claim no soul
Never let an anchor drop
Never had a home, never talk to strangers
Never trust a friend
This is the life and the life will not end

Money (Repeat 8x) - - ] Mr. Lif

[Verse 2: Aesop Rock + El-P + Mr. Lif]
Next time think
39 thieves are quicker than 40 winks...
Raise your drinks
39 thieves are quicker than 40 winks

We're not concerned with the community aloofness
Dude, we're animals, we just go where the most food is
Lower the toast, most formal etiquette is useless
Truth is you're equally expendable if spoon-fed
(Money money)
Money is cool, I'm only human
But they use it as a tool to make the workers feel excluded
Like the shinier the jewel the more exclusive the troop is
Bullets don't take bribes stupid, they shoot shit

(Another dark night)
Calicos tread around the rabbit hole
Weapons to the heavens and arsenic where the carrots grows
Piss warm sugar water, what a summer canteen
Plus burned rubber like "green is the new green"
Rubber neck froze, slows by the multiplex
Rodeo commotion, I'm open to see what culminates
Bougie on the right, left rep rebel force
Both say the feud will prove the parking lot was never yours
Black top pebble wars
Soldiers molded where the jonesʼs every grown-up
Wants decoded came to grow in
No motive, it showed up in gross quotas
Hog barn burner come see if your homes hold us
Eighty-five rattle-trap parked and fancy
You could swear he was stepping out of Comanche, antsy
Let us in the jetty when they jettison the medicine
And paranormal hatchet and cadets to break the levees in
(Money money)
Both know the totem camaraderie
Token of equality, they post it horizontally
Crown the golden loading dock, they crawl to lodge the colony
Half-mast flags, half cabs loiter properly
And sleep the sleep of the just ready on the left
Where the witchcraft spun out of a neighboring sect
With the usual undesirables and the big brother cutters
On the day your name became "This Motherfucker?"

This-is-the-life (Repeat 3x)
The people are dead, but the money keeps talking 
This-is-the-life
Talking 
This-is-the-life
Money money 
This-is-the-life

Flash that buttery gold
Jittery zeitgeist, wither by the watering hole, what a patrol
What are we to Heart Huckabee, art fuckery suddenly
Not enough young in his lung for the water wings
Colorfully vulgar poacher, out of mulch
Like, "I'ma pull the pulse out a soldier and bolt."
Fine, sign of the time we elapse
When a primate climb up a spine and attach
Eye for an eye, by the bog life swamps and vines
They get a rise out of frogs and flies
So when a dogfight's hog-tied prize sort of costs a life
The mouths water on a fork and knife
And the allure isn't right
No score on a war-torn beach
Where the cash cow's actually beef
Blood turns wine when it leak for police
Like, "That's not a riot; it's a feast, let's eat!"

And I will remember your name and face
On the day you are judged by the funhouse cast
And I will rejoice in your fall from grace
With a cane to the sky, like, "None shall pass."
None shall pass, none shall pass

Now, if you never had a day a snow cone couldn't fix
You wouldn't relate to the rogue vocoder blitz
How he spoke through a NoDoz motor on the fritz
‘Cause he wouldn't play rollover fetch like a bitch
And express no regrets, though he isn't worth a homeowner's piss
To the jokers who pose by the glitz
Fine, sign of the swine in the swarm
When a king is a whore who comply and conform
Miles outside of the eye of the storm
With a siphon to lure out a prize and award
While avoiding the vile and bazaar that is violence and war
True blue triumph is more
Like, "Wait, let him snake up out of the centerfold
Let it break the walls of Jericho, ready go."
Sat where the old, cardboard city folk
Swap tales with heads, like every other penny throw

And I will remember your name and face
On the day you are judged by The Funhouse cast
And I will rejoice in your fall from grace
With a cane to the sky, like, "None shall pass."
None shall pass, none shall pass

You tried, you tried, you tried to trick me
You've got a, you've, you've got a, a lot of nerve
I'm, I'm not, I'm not, trying to trick you
I'm try, I'm try, I'm trying to help

Okay, woke to a grocery list, goes like this
Duty and death; anyone object, come stand in the way
You could be my little Snake River Canyon today
And I ran with a chain of commands
And a jetpack strapped where the backstab lands if it can
Fine, sign of the vibe in the crowd
When I cut a belly open to find what climb out
That's quite a bit of gusto he muster up
To make a dark horse rush, like, "Enough's enough!"
It must've struck a nerve so they huff and puff
'Til all the king's men fluster and clusterfuck
And it's a beautiful thing
To my people who keep an impressive wingspan
Even when the cubicle shrink
You got to pull up the intruder by the root of the weed
N.Y. Chew through the machine

And I will remember your name and face
On the day you are judged by The Funhouse cast
And I will rejoice in your fall from grace
With a cane to the sky, like, "None shall pass."
None shall pass, none shall pass

Reeeeeemix!
...Throw your babies in the air

Dead men tell no tales (Uh-huh)
Up push the daisies till the soil is stale
In a powder blue tux for the farmer's sale (Here we go)
Mr. Big sleep with the carp and kelp

Once upon a time in the days of yore
When the people lived fresh outta legend and folklore
There was an old pirate who piloted vile slang
Had a bird perched on him and swash buckled the same
Peg leg navigate him starboard to port
By the nautical starry night yelling "The harbor is yours!"
And you should tell them where you situate the gold
That is unless you'd like a vacation with Davy J-J-J-Jones
Like "walk the plank" for whom the shark thank
Maroon the mutineers consume the souvenirs
And while the shiny spoils piled higher every year
He was suffocating slow in the box of a buccaneer
Ten summers prior on a night like this
Crows nest scopes something afloat to the boats west
Swore it blew him a kiss
When he focus seen the face of an angel upon the body of a
F-f-f-fish
"What the heck!" frazzled, his telescope shattered
Gathered himself she was ghost he was down the rope ladder
To deck circled the vessel 360 swiftly
Found nothing in the water but salt, piss and whiskey
Yarr, heckled by the swabbies at the bar
He'll be the laughing stock of the Barbary Coast War
Like this dude either got two glass eyes
Or he wearing his patch on the wrong s-s-s-side
Now he knew what he saw
But had to prove he was raw
So he raped and he pillaged and
And he feud and he brawled
Try to rekindle his rep via sabers and gun smoke
And vowed to always find her though he never told his cutthroats
Meanwhile, back in the now, got a brand new skeleton crew
On the move out when they aren't manning thirty burning cannons stern and bow
They are prying shiny metals out your m-m-m-mouth
Okay, youth wanes old age holler wisdom and disease
Like the scurvy made his yellow gums bleed
And he was achy from his boots to the feather in his hat
Until his quartermaster showed up with a stolen treasure map
One look down and lept off the dock
See if you can guess where X marked the spot
The capital was buried at sea in a cursed cave
Only one mile from where he'd seen the mer-mer-mer-maid
Anchors up, hoist the jolly roger thank you much
Day and night with his hook hands raised and clutched
But see the vitamin deficiency was strong
So by the time they bumped into the island he could barely lift his grog
Crawled off the boat, collapsed in the sand
Prayers in the air, seashells in his hand
And nary a high tide so grand as the one that put
The lady of the lake on dry la-la-la-land
I wish I could tell you that it ended happy
Pretend like his bones weren't practically snapping
Pretend like her gills didn't dry up and suffer
But that's a half-dead pirate and a fish outta water
No lie, scout's honor, got a million more
From the burgundy lighting above the shores of whores
Before your visions of grandeur go to swell those sails
Remember dead men tell no t-t-t-tales

Dead men tell no tales
..Dead men tell no tales
..Dead men tell no tales

Sharks in the dunk tank, vipers in the garden
Locusts stole the groceries out the local Farmer's Market
All God's critters hold positions
Some are violent, some are victims
Each alive is an equal and vital piston I support
So when the piranhas honor New York
My daddy long legs dangled and mangled for sport
And while I bring in every dink in the kingdom with open wings
It all boils down to them shit-soaked pigs
The pigs (what), the pigs (what), the dregs of what y'all aim for
The gluttonous muddy stomachs under the pudgy cakehole
Two-track braniac using the food and payroll
To chew up and consume every cookie, crumb, and peso
And place a cloven hoof on the lucrative when convenient
As the bourbon-odor smokers' coughs smolder off the Cohiba
If Noah had the benefit of hindsight on his ship
He could've snatched two unicorns and left behind the motherfucking...

Pigs!
God damn... pigs!
Potbelly... pigs!
Punch-drunk... pigs!
Take money, money... pigs!
Loudmouth... pigs!
Wide load... pigs!
Let's make a deal...

When all the wolves in woolly wigs
Have huffed, and puffed, and blew the bricks
The skulls of Brooklyn's cruelest pigs
Will rain on Fulton's newest kicks
As mulish swine of all surrounding counties sniff the gruesomeness
We pass around the pineapples and pull the pins in unison
I will gladly feed you to the breed who wants you sacrificed
No pagan or sacrilege, just bacon for scavengers
I will gladly seat you with the chickens, not the passengers
Hopefully the crack in his armor spreads to his avarice
Never that, Wilburs multiply quicker than triples
And hunt their truffles in fistfuls, but it was all bells and whistles
Bougie this and Bougie that...
War pig or pussy cat...
Glitzy to the pork ribs, had to gold-leaf the booby traps
Powder-pink, double-breasted, mess of mud and money
Waddle off the fire to make his stubborn tummy wroggle
And while I don't really know the working details of your tribes
I know that that's one ugly fucking tie
Asshole...

Apple in his mouth, Maraschino eyes
Party like the butcher boy's cleaver is alive
I mosey into sixteen hours of smoke in the misty winter
To see the county fair's blue ribbon winner as dinner
Then dance until the sun has kissed your blisters in the morning
As the misery was dormant and digging in crispy portions
Corporates want to lure him in and whore him. Or does he whore the corparates to expand the more important forums for him
Push the mortar pestle past the ordinary orchard
When the frilly border's faded is the product mine or yours, pig?
Mine, plus I toss a token where I go:
Directly to the worms who shovel shit and yellow snow
This little piggy went to the market with a target
And will subsequently know the armor-piercing forks of farmers
Final words for the finer birds taking notes:
I dig a chick in pig tails, "That's all Folks!"

For want of a nail the shoe was lost
For want of a shoe the horse was lost
For want of a horse the rider was lost
For want of a rider the battle was lost
For want of a battle the kingdom was lost
And all for the want of a horseshoe nail

There is a hole in front of the shovel
Shovel in front of the brawn
Six billion gorillas for whom the graves yawn
Each within his mulish days to choose his tool of trade
Dueling blades that cued a cruel charade and fuel the flames
Few would clue the crew into the civil
Skip the food and land like you the man
Who flew the coop over the pitbulls
Dash back flashy to compassionate nanopolice who sat beneath an avalanche of jagged inadequacies
And I was "Stop the Violence" more than I was Pontius Pilate
Cops and robbers riot by the five's obnoxious sirens
A is gullible he figure, "all man equal, no brainer"
Take it his friends and neighbors didn't cater
Moms raised the babies through a very churchy 80's
Sunday mornings reinforce the waiting gates of Hades
And he brazen but apparently inferno bound now
For when a man of cloth recite his wrongs he wouldn't bow down
The punishment should fit the reasons you must punish him
Never puncture skin or pull the colored rugs from under them
Two opposing mother ships shall not employ the gunners deck
Cause brotherhoods of public good do not employ the unctuous
And you. observe and have the givetheth disproportionate
To the taketh away decide to maketh his day (do it)
All the stoic odium glow in a cold holster
To where he coulda stood easily in the tub jugglin toasters

No mountain too high
No city too far
No coma tonight
No city tomorrow
No fire too live
No city too charred
No treaty to sign
No city to guard

I picked the phone up with a grown-up mode approach
Skin crawlin off the drawl and now I claw the awkward tone up
I'd known it wasn't roses
But hoped it was less corrosive
Coastin to the focus of the grossest diagnosis
Like homes, the barnacles that chew upon the flesh of man
Have clued into the suitor was capital to a beggar's hand
And uncomfortably. sung a stubborn legacy of gluttony
With carnivores that burrow like hunters into the blood in meat - umm, what?
Chinny chin-up and the city picked this
In a pent-up letter numbed the spitting stigma
Along came a spider, sold her eggs to any buyer
Now to shoot a ringer back with six legs wider than the driver
If you make no friends on the way to the top rung
There is no secret handshake club I do not give a fuck
But know the cancers make the olive branches obviously standard
So when they extend from the yachts and mansions drop your canons
All kings hang em for the cliffs side drip dry
Will he clip the zipline or slip for his final dip dive?
If he live will he survive the milligrams of middle-ground
They pump into the pin-striped pentagrams over Tinsel-town
Or kill a man who trickled down the city with his scissors out
Or sickles, dipped in military hells bells and whistles
Riders to the east, not a wild tribes
Thank you for the peace on earth and mercy miles high

No mountain too high
No city too far
No coma tonight
No city tomorrow
No fire too live
No city too charred
No treaty to sign
No city to guard

(Good evening
All right
Yeah
Happy to be breathing
Yeah
I am alive
Yeah
Yeah)

"You look like you've seen a ghost"

Are you asleep?
Or are you
Are you awake?
Nah, man, I'm done
I'm showered, I'm everything
Ate some fuckin' Lucky Charms
Let's go

Most copious
Rains soaked the opiates
Notice how the phobias appropriately procreate
Woke up with a ghost farm
Focused on his groceries
When they aren't telling stories, they are multiplying grossly
On the lawn
Let 'em loiter, never let 'em spawn
The apparitions have been drinking his water for too long
So when they gathered by the birdbath in the morning, he would tell 'em
"I mean no disrespect but you have all outstayed your welcome"
Interesting in a sense
Interrupt commiserating phantoms on your picket fence
How quickly they will lift their heads
And breathe an ultimatum like the dead don't argue
Said, "You're living by the bayonet (but how alive are you?)"
Shit, A is all juice and bad etiquette
Elbows on the table
Lobster bibbin' on the ready set
He said, "But how alive?"
I dunno, homie, you decide
(No, you decide) Fine
How alive? Too alive
(How alive?) Too alive
(How alive?) Too alive
And one by one around the yard 'til each one felt communal pride
Like they had done their little part in cleaning up the public
With a steaming plate of justice for them Easy Baker stomachs (Say what?)
We the legends that hunt with the unremembered
Geriatric lore in the clutch of the budding censor
Who snuck around the art police and all related governments
To infiltrate a human lung and hike up off his tongue and lip
Ahh, money's in the market for a mothership
To double as a vessel that drag his legacy under it
And who am I to hang him out to dry by the heat
When, if rehydrating fails, we're all dumber because of me?
Zombies of the antiquated nation chatter quietly
The "Too alive" channel from the library of rivalry
And summers in the mud (Mud)
Winters by the tracks (Tracks)
No story goes untold
Aes is back

I got a handful rockin' the same poker-face
Down to dance around the table like they own the place

"You look like you've seen a ghost"

I got the whole world thinkin' it's a holiday
'Cause they can smell the chum in the water from miles away

"You look like you've seen a ghost"

(How alive?) Too alive
(How alive?) Too alive
(How alive?) Too alive
(How alive?) Too alive
(How alive?) Too alive
(How alive?) Too alive
(How alive?) Too alive
(How alive?) Too alive

Before shooting troops was cooler than hula hoops
High noon was your basic who's who of brutal truth
Hot summer gun or box-cutter slow dance
Turn a young'n to a dozen paper dolls holding hands
And tricky was a wooden horse pushed up on your porch
So chicanery was yours to engage or ignore
I was on the latter, but a lot adopt pawns
So we carried lawn chairs and buckets of popcorn
(Pass the popcorn) Brawl fair, cop car
Voyeur hawk him out his hinges, storm door splinters
Clamoring about, hammers out about to ring
Infiltrate each others tribes and murder each others queens
Packed to the very last rafter
Clung to the rafts and the cameras to capture the damage
Neck swivel with a chop chop volley
Where the ants leave nothing, but the bones and the car keys
Pardon if his two feet fester, it was rude of me people, meet left and lefter
Planted like a model of civility and honor for the sector
But never got his extra extra
Peace for the better but it wasn't entertaining
So they waited for the tazing from the safety of his haven
Like bees to the honey when they lumped you up
Cause bumper cars are only funny when they bump
Know that...

Hot summer gun or box-cutter slow dance- popcorn, popcorn...
Hot summer gun or box-cutter slow dance- capture the damage

(Yo, this dude talks real slow yo... Crazy
Yeah man that's my boy Steve; he just talks like that, it's weird
That is weird.)

Each one teach one how to club one- popcorn, popcorn...
Each one teach one how to club one- popcorn... wouldn't you agree that it is fabulous?

(Yo honestly, if your man Steve really talks like that... uh, that's not really normal...
Yeah, that sucks... Yeah, it's pretty bad...
Nobody's voice should sound like that.)

It was a lazy day, it was amazing grace
It was a half-a-dozen claymores daisy-chained
It wasn't daisies and crazy
Eights, it was an ace of spades over a waiting game of slaves
And saints, and every trainee face-painted while his great
Escape grazed and ate
He'll never make it, when he aims he shakes
And I was overly engrossed from a very locked door
With a couple milk duds and buckets of popcorn
(Pass the popcorn) Clap clap, encore, monkey in the middle study
How the bunker took the missiles, age of machines with nary a green
Screen, so the hecatomb is every bit as cutty as it seems
I could tell the pet from the vet, money where his canine's spread
And never welched on a bet, that said, know the over-under
On your local hunter and you'll profit off his widow-maker's
Numbers every summer, bump in the night, funny, will he catch and release 'em?
Has he mercy, will he hack 'em to pieces?
Is he dirty, will he hassle policeman and security breach until impurities leak over the circuitry?
And nada milk and honey there is only skulls and bunnies
That hop around drunk in the land of a hundred Mondays
God damn, pop the redenbacher proper and
For Christ's sake get this man a doctor!

Six in the morning and the walls close in
High noon calls and the walls own him
Kings at the ready know the walls won't win

Storms on the harbor like a harbinger of gore (Right)
Gore is my harbinger, pardon The Art of War (Right)
Get your doors darkened
By the house of card carpenters
Who never thought a slave could be a Spartacus and more
Pencil sharpener with a resume for the carnivores
Who take important conference calls in corner office walls
Still, a buck is a buck and he punch numbers
Five - punch
Just say no to company functions
And he duck into the dungeons
Nothing says "Kill it" like a day of fetching
Paper clips and staplers for the privileged
Two lives, one is chores for whores
One is where I wanna be when you begin regretting yours
And I poured in with a large coffee
Tardy every morning
To a man who took authority beyond what it was for
How you gonna pay the rent day-job-free?
Make rap records, matter of fact, thanks, peace

In a (Getaway car, geta-getaway car)

Kings at the ready know the walls won't win

"I-I-I'm leavin'"

"You ain't shit man, your story's a joke
You should package it with a last smoke and six feet of rope."

Stay awake little misfit
Her lips wet a very particular mischief
Sis' wiggle an index, if your limbs let
Or settle for a warm, burgundy bubble out of her beak instead

Hey, tequila to free the worm
Had his liver scuba suit up on the Sabbath
His personal pale rabbit
At the hole's end her delicate mitten tipped
For sticking pissy liquor in him every day at six
Silly, predictability is a bitch
Fully patterned, had her awkwardly christening the small talk chalk board
She said, "This is less of a fixer-upper than my last bar."
"Funny, you're less of a fixer-upper than my last whore."
Crass is Similac to the milky wit of today's youths
Both chuckle out
Next couple on the house
Next couple on the couch
Swapping social coma rants
Phobias and soldier doubts, jokes and corporate mogul bans
Motor-mouths
The key to open his closure:
Pussy plus yay; she hid in a broken toaster
And later wake neighbors over chemical flavor to fuck sickly
Tooth, nail beauty through the skin deep

An object at rest tends to remain at rest
And an object in motion tends to remain in motion
With the same speed... slow down
With the same speed... slow down
With the same speed... slow down
And in the same direction
Down... down... down...

Now the dizziness is similar to whimsy with a pretty twist
If pretty is a bidding war for meteors of iffy sniff
And cigarettes, and pills on a speaker
Silhouetted by the muted television and the rickety Venetians
Between tweaks, he sweeps at home depot and reads
Mostly biblical, but not cause he believed
But found the lexicon of Jesus-heavy literature fly
Feverishly sponged up the information high
Fade into the cradle of his same deck train wreck
She pet him with a mechanical tape deck play back
Plus, the depressing sum of the two combined pay checks
Stung less when little Debbie D-cup put her legs back
Drunk, put her on the business-end of his favorite couplet from Corinthians
Sunk into the comforts of a kid again
Enough to share the stuff that truly interest him
This is where the vision of a shiny, happy Christmas end
Tipsy little princess wasn't listening, just yes-ing him
The more she fed him "yes", the more he fed her fresh barbiturates
Assuming it was them against the world into oblivion
But he was just a stupid simian that her live with him

An object at rest tends to remain at rest
And an object in motion tends to remain in motion
With the same speed... slow down
With the same speed... slow down
With the same speed... slow down
And in the same direction
Down... down... down...

Pirouetting madly on a mirror full of baggies
In the valley of the irritable Aggie
Any sincerity, miracles, or memory buried in the back-seat
By the hazardous materials was seriously gasping
Here he is in action trying to patch up the attraction
Figured he would win her back if he act in a common passion
Penned a couple chapters 'bout a sassy pair of magnets
With a cottage on a hill and a picket fence and a marriage
Never having gathered her rabid enthusiasm over language
Was fashioned around the aspirin in his cabinets
Asked her to read it expecting flattery after the fact
This is an exact imitation of how she react:
"You ain't shit man, your story's a joke
You should package it with a last smoke and six feet of rope."
Man she knows five chores, more coke, and all fours
Said, "Leave me on the floor and leave the dope by the door."
Bounced all shook up, she cook up aluminum
Consuming every skull and crossbones in the room
In under two minutes, he fuming with a flipped lid, stormed into the crib
And found her body on the tiles like, "No she didn't!", yes she did

Stay awake little misfit
Her lips wet a very particular mischief
Sis' wiggle an index, if your limbs let
Or settle for a warm burgundy bubble out of her beak instead

An object at rest tends to remain at rest
And an object in motion tends to remain in motion
With the same speed... slow down
With the same speed... slow down
With the same speed... slow down
And in the same direction
Down... down... down...

Take-take the medicine, tastes great
Got the key to the city, I’m wake-baked
Way before the media shitting or 12 zip of ganked paint
The origin of a thievery leader will take place
Two coke bottles adorn the rogue toddler
Grapple a refrigerator, gaffle a Nilla Wafer
And no role model provoke him to shift focus
Cause he noticed that a cookie tastes better when it's stolen
Kids got the darnedest quirks
So 11's arms skip jars for his momma's purse
And bought enough fireworks from the bullies to blow up a small barn
Which he kept in a box in the yard
And the bark isn't carved from a klepto-anthem
But a klepto-tangent prefaced the grand canvas
Dance to the dirge, stand up
Celebrate the natural need to own what ain't earned
See it rolls off the tongue
Like a smoke ring rolls off a lung 'til it's done
Ready, set, kept petty theft on a post-it
Later apply the motives to a moment on some grown shit
"Hey, you with the sharpie and BM!"
Did you foreplay the GM, or you carpe the diem?
Whore play the porn game, fornicate the sure way to freedom
Or correlate with the swordplay and heathens?
Trickery and backtalk, fresh outta high school
On the prickly catwalk of the modern grind slide rule
Every last number in its history
Got is own little hustle to nuzzle up with the victory
Thanks, bathe in a bottle of your finest
Tackleberry sift through the piss looking for diamonds
Before the hell appears to put the chemi in the climate
Get your money from the richest, get your pussy from the flyest

Slow and low, do or die calm, suicide king in the tuck of the palm
Slow and low, do or die stuck, two to five cans in the tuck of the trunk
And these are the five fingers that are stealing from you
And these are the five fingers that are stealing from you
And these are the five fingers that are stealing from you...
(Capture the flag)
(Capture the flag)
(Capture the flag)

One by one like little confused penguins
Larceny's yes-men ooze for used weapons
Like a bitter little burglar jaded up out the bucket seat
Is dumb enough to feel like the public owe him a fucking thing
Nope, gotta configure the five finger
So the hot-wired vehicular skill is applicable
If an eye's on the prize and the itch ain't flushed
I hope the fruits of your labor outlive the initial rush, like
Step on the abysmal cusp
With matchmakers trying to make the mixed signals fuck
Then incubate the mutt baby through his stigma's crutch
Like he will learn to walk after he lifts the drums
And this is certified milk by the New York Department of Skullduggery
Shoplift quicker than your shutter speed, click!
Missed, he dipped with dumb cutlery
In and out of muddy river water 'til the rudder bleed
Skip around the money pillar, color me bunny killer
Hovering where the mother feed, gutter greed king
And a crummy motherfucker breed fuck with me
It go knock knock rummy at a bruckner speed
The seed's all growns up playing grown people games
Evil aims grown, encompass the whole steeple chase
Grip, mitigate the master plan
So when the workers are asleep, riffraff expands
Yes a pig is a cop, but gotta fill up the flock
So when I rake in the bacon I hope the kiddies'll watch
I hope the flipping of the system will be heavily clocked
Cause opportunity's fickle, after it trickle it stop
Capture the flag, drag that crass little bastard
Flat through the hazmat and glass
Laugh when he ask for it back; scratch that:
Welcome to the magic in a basket of cash

Slow and low, do or die calm, suicide king in the tuck of the palm
Slow and low, do or die stuck, two to five cans in the tuck of the trunk
And these are the five fingers that are stealing from you
And these are the five fingers that are stealing from you
And these are the five fingers that are stealing from you...
(Capture the flag)
(Capture the flag)
(Capture the flag)
(Capture the flag)
(Cap-cap-capture the flag)

Limped up like a dog with three legs (shut-up) to the stage...
So many dark arts to choose
You can focus to the phobias involved in forty hues
Whether you levitate or bend spoons
Tune into the prudence of the
Dark Heart News

A system of gods
From each of the brawling tribes
So my bible is a pot of qualms, clipped and collaged
Pavlov's bad dogs parry mass bells
I don't speak the language but my last laughs held

Okay the rotary corner
Grow to be notably mobile
And social gopher teeth form holes
Or any scene where Brie is normal
We'll locate every exit, had seconds to flee the wormhole
When emergency diversions ring the celly or the door bell

Whether you levitate or bend spoons
Whether you levitate or bend spoons
Whether you levitate or bend spoons
Whether you levitate or bend spoons

(Scratched) Extra, extra, read all about me

'ey, four corners of the globe All invent fire on the very same day in the very same cold
Each sent a man with torch to the border line to boast
Watch them collide and explode

What plague?
Make an idolant brigade
So eager to walk planks
They will climb a tree and wait
Their irony is waning over piety and faith
So when the ghostly ruminations come
We'll kindly disobey it
I will live to be a thousand with the patience of a saint
To see the hoi polloi becoming restless in their tanks
Can't hold howls in corrals with a key
So will the worms please shriek on the count of three
(THREE!)

Sideways eye on a sinister boundary
Panel of contemporaries killing me loudly
99 models of fear on the wall timorous
Done running into to the car on the wrong cinder blocks

Whether you levitate or bend spoons
Whether you levitate or bend spoons
Whether you levitate or bend spoons
Whether you levitate or bend spoons

Three legged dogs that chew up the wrong food
Riff Raff (?) with (?) wolves
Land sharks know to take money, money, lose
Dark Heart News!
AHH!

Extra, extra, read all about me
At the bottom of our news tonight

We don't need no walkie-talkies, nope no walkie talkies
We don't need your coughing when offing the morning coffee
No, we don't need no walkie-talkies, nope no walkie-talkies
We just want our hermitry to stay and our coffee to go

And the last shall be
First to immerse in the pass out heat
Face in the mud where the moxie melt
'Till he woke up drowning in tchotchke hell
More in a cave with a torch on the wall
Than a window arrangement of porcelain dolls
On a brand new day, saw what he saw
Property owners who crawl to the mall
With a bad toupee and a face like he author the law
Pace like he mourning a loss
Right hand on a can of worms
Left full of gold he will trade for turf, I mean
That's ok, you got to answer to you at the end of the volatile day
But a model of mercy and might, no way
Marionette who will clap and obey
Dude, look, all that noise
Call that flight of the water boys
Meet and greet and they all slap five
Cheek to cheek when they colonize
And a grown-ass man shall abide as he wish
Walk that path with a dime and a stick
Walk that path with a diamond and wine
Walk that path to the firing line
Just walk, pay no mind
To the new recruit with the play-doh spine
Let's be friends from opposite ends
Wave to the kid don't hop on the fence
Play to the radius far and away
Orbit wide don't park in his space
One little martyr who talk in his face
Make one little Weathermen sharpen the blades

And the last shall be
First to the curb with the mad cow meat
Face in the bars of a regular cell
When he woke up high in collectible hell
Boom town kid who was taught by the binge
That a man who expire with the most shit win
That's warpy american nonsense penned by the rich
Not a routine friend in a pinch
Still not used to the stench
How it throws off otherwise lucid events
In the case the afraid observe
I got a Pro-Keds box full of layman's terms, it goes
Hey, peace, pray for the plagued
Major relief and capacious rains
But just cuz I don't want to war with you
It don't mean go warm up the barbecue
I'm like pardon you, sawed off limit
My high noon is a quick little minute
I don't wanna spend it sitting with a critic
Who simply isn't going to ever really get it
This HQ is alive and alone
No driveway no sign of a home
No dial tone, no line for the phone
No world's tiniest violin song
And I might just lie to them all, lie in the morgue
With a deep breath hiding and bored
Fighting a smile, highly annoyed
When the timing is right I will rise and record
Call for the monster beats and Blockhead got
Animal drums like he's doctor teeth
It goes red light green light 1 2 3
One large coffee, fuck you, peace

T-A-K-E-N-O-P-R-I-S-O-N-E-R-S
T-A-K-E-N-O-P-R-I-S-O-N-E-R-S
T-A-K-E-N-O-P-R-I-S-O-N-E-R-S

I stood before the glittery borders of new radius
In search of the fabled city of mud and crushed velvet
What I found was a gutter where the love of entertainment
Meets the lust for blood and demerits

Cutters of the pie throw your summers in the sky
Collar-pop Jolly Roger die motherfucker die
Apache on a ship shape, in Bristol fashion
Snuck a jammy through the red tape and tiptoed past him
Worm teeth grinding feverishly below
As little organic hacksaws eager to feed and grow
So when it's Blackhawk over the glass walk
They surface up through the cash crops
With clippers for your belly-up mascots and never dine alone
Meanwhile, back at sea level, it was home by home zone for zone
Bloom County's homeless riot for home ownership
I hope you put gas in the motor-home and know the roads
I studied with the finest combs stuck under my thumb
As opposed to the loaded nose who pray Armageddon is numb
And that's unevenly rendered
To those who grew up thinking faith was a surrender of reason
But not a reason to surrender
Catch the Liberty Fire's catalog
Forty torched orchids and citronella for Algernon
Don and Vagabond alike repent
This shit should have been Beta burns Babylon, the end

And when the radio stars climbed up out of the floors
To murder the medium that shot 'em thirty years before
They said
Kill television
Kill television
Kill television
Difficult isn't it
And when the cutters of the pie throw their summers in the sky
No love lost baby, the future is so bright
Kill television
Kill television
Kill television
Difficult isn't it

Nothing says charm like an armored car
Taking the clone-farm 'tards to the arms bazaar
We were the homemade marker makers born to pour the marsh ink into right guard parts
And march through the gauntlet of car alarms
No harps, no delusions of losing with something prettier
Than ash around the metacarpal still clutching the teddy bears
But we can run with scissors through the city fair
Or situate the nuzzle with the subtle art of splitting hairs
Double park the shuttle, some will arc the funneled cutty sark
Where budding narcs target the gushing heart in the muddy Clarks
These are the vices of the p-noid bastards
Who will chew whatever tablets blur the axioms fastest
But crews lose lunches by the hundreds
Lose electricity, lose gas, phone, plumbing
Humming keep your mouth closed
Keep your cows cloned, go
I am the pulse of this fucking town homes know
My what a convenient embargo
At least I'll always know which side of the gun I'm supposed to buy the farm from
The too-far-gone kicks, still in the box
Fix, still in the pill in his sock
Chilling, gill in the slop and a million watch Gideon scribes
But once the arc honor pussy and bribes, the animals will divide
And that's a win for the garish who keep charity in the parish
While profiting off the lack of a marriage amongst the classes

The mobile infantry is so postal
Coast into the quotient provoking the local Pistol Pete
Choking his liberty and justice quotas and cloaking his folk in smithereens
Smokey little pile of bloody pulp and co-dependencies
Dopey, no surrender, bender in effect
Sole defenders of the longest night New York had never slept
And there were jumping jacks and whistlers over Christmas
Like Rockets From The Crypt spilling the festive morning beverage of your preference
I step in Hog Heaven, stony, with no weapons
Pissing on teleprompters, selling megaphones to hecklers
Who broadcast eighty million versions of the sermon
For that one indisputable masterpiece before the curtains
Pale, Arcadian moon, high-definition, flat plasma
IMAX, city-wide transfer
Artificial Einstein-Rosen out the tenement
Ease into the Xanadu, let it hammer the tension out
I'm talking cool, calm, dominant phenomenal
Monitor face to the wall opposite
U.F.O.'s and locusts sing the same old song
While the Weathermen get retarded as the day is long

I was a dark, dumb student, no hooky rookie
Day tripping on visions of chickens that look like R. Crumb drew em
They grew em in a royal dirt of Suffolk County's
Flooring with the blood of an alcoholic clergyman in his forearms
Long Island was porn stars and puppies pushing sniffles
Fit into the aforementioned or slipped through the pinholes
Zook slipped through the pinholes
Crispy the God sender
Who thunk over a quarter plunk to local Mortal Kom vender
Both the formal squad censor, look down
Either side across the marsh before it was awesome cars
My calling card cavalry cooking an '85 Dodge Ares
Gas for Huntington and back barely
Equipped with Super-Soakers full of piss
And an uncanny knack for constantly upsetting pigs by doing stupid shit
The kid piloted his ring king dummies to King Kullen
Where he hollered fuck the world from a parking lot in the suburbs
What's this
A couple spray cans and a little litter
But they'd look at us like swindlers with them Ricky Kasso jitters
So fuck em, a glutton sunk into the alley for props
But things will still go bump when them halogens pop
Believe I'll be there when it happens
The shaking of the plates off the mantle
The snaking of the flames off the candle
The lady of the lake off the answers
Admitting the mistakes to their deplaning cadavers
Now it's rest in peace Will Peterson whose heater sung disturbingly to
Further re-evaluate your beast of burden's urgency
Damn doggy, good times, thanks
I wrote your name in wet cement by the Brooklyn Banks
What's this

I'm an activator
Made a fire, made a wheel, made a snack for later
Catacomb kids cuddle up and test the flavor
When the towns speed freaks sleep
Trap the traitor, he will ask for papers
What's this
Say I'm an activator
Made a roof, made a weapon, made a flag per acre
By the snotty little muzzle of a latch-key neighbor
When the folk push aggie over some dap with gators
He will catch the vapors

Couple Playboy mudflaps and hell on his heels
Beautifully echoed in the pace at which he shovel his meals
Like not a farmer among us had a harvest survive the winter
So dinner split a lima bean in triplets, pick a winner
Took a couple summers puking pills behind the dumpster
As the largest Pez dispenser on record recouped his numbers
One shoe in the soupy gutter
One shoe in the velvet heaven
Where the mermaids told him shake em by the lake of melted weapons
What's this
You could dance purty with the hooligan nation
Who will be patiently awaiting zoo-keeper facelift
Extra the days of yore painted similar uber-ape shit
We've merely updated the ancient 8-bit
Yeah I'm dumber than a cow on a roof in a flood
Who's not as dumb as the watered-down beef from the burgers that jumped
I'm dumber than a Taz on a beach chair with a martini
Who's not as dumb as the tat wit the same scenery
What's this
Sparky nails pig stigmata for all good sport
Garbage pail kids unite at the mall food court
They chase cheese fries with Binaca
They had shut the school down early
There were bombs inside the lockers
No concept of the problem
We responded like a snow day
It was clobber shit to flotsam
Til the cops said it was okay
Okay show the squadrons back into their boxes
Like his Breakfast Club of hotheads show no progress to the doctors
And I walk into the office, coughing awful ether often
Flood a parking meter fever, knuckle up for Love and Rockets
It was reign of the razor laser
Day of the cloudy howdy
Flight of the shelter melter
You can bow without me
What's this

Watch me jump
What's this
Knock em out the box, Aes

This is my friend Tony
He's pretty cool, although he's not always so smart

And then they were eight
Just like that, just like that...
(Bring back Pluto, back-back Pluto)
(Back-back Pluto, Plu-Plu-Pluto)

In the beginning it was Large Marge sent me, I'm bent
Empty the rent if you can double park the garbage barge gently
The moon took a second mortgage on the seventh house
And Jupiter ain't talk to Mars, he felt the host of rovers sold him out
Close your mouth, poke your snout over the cloaked aroma clouds
Solar boy elope with couch ogling older Polaroids
Motor mouth, chauffeur the golden molar toy
Gophers yoke a fish out of water, he grows lungs and multiplies
Idle when soldering a perfect union
It is vital to calculate any ornery loose ends
So if mutiny ensues the aloof is assumed nuisance
The clue is in his vacancy, the proof is in his goosebumps
Maroon the traitors expecting acres of edelweiss
Who later learn it may actually be safer to play with knives
I show up late looking project grizzly
Two bowies, a third for throwing and accomplish dickweed
Nothing, nada, nill, I stuff a lot of pill to gut
What's the proper rules on stuffing hostages in trucks?
I'll be numb enough to chill before the choppers spill the blood
But if I'm not!
Fuck it, plug him, warpy got his goddamned groove back
Jet-setting on spec with a dead yeti on the roof rack
And miscreants will rubberneck jalopy euthanasia
Which will later be regretted when it's your turn for cremation
And I walk like early man, freak a little witch hunt
Gathering the carnies and exploiting every stigma
The malformed oddities among sovereignty's normal
Shall abuse every vice you can imagine right before you

All I thought of was the cloven-hooved
And how they clip-clip-clop over the woven roofs
With a nose for commotion and stolen goods
Now tell me, what the fuck am I supposed to do?
In the mean time (nine) minus (one) left (eight)
In the mean time (nine) minus (one) left (eight)
In the mean time (nine) minus (one) left (eight)
We were busy putting barbs on a large iron gate

(Mercury, Venus, Earth, Mars, Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, Neptune)
(Bring back Pluto, back-back Pluto)
(Back-back Pluto, Plu-Plu-Pluto)
They're all-they're gonna want his milk money next

Stare into the glowing eye of Cerberus and crow
Authoritative laminates will not repel the quarantined alone
All the town sickly know the Coke machine as home
Where they sit and hope the Ovaltine that noble's drink is strong
Couples only roller rink with soul to kiss your chicken noodle
Before they wiggle mittens through the pillory to ridicule
And you can hear the iron maidens lock
Or see the town criers ankle stock chained up to the tanker truck
A is up early, ring and run thank you much
Document a little of that underbelly bang for buck
Hey I walk as the hype of the city gossip
Meaning every dumpster diver's gotta vomit up a comment like
Um you ain't shit, this ain't ill
This is little Russian dolls that get smaller and smaller still
This a corpse full of pills trying to sit still and build
Cause eight planets bullied number nine until he fell
Babylon goggles, gawk for the galvatron coppers
Tugboat salvage all fossils
I'll be shepherd when the whirlybirds deny the lepers doctors
If I'm not, fuck it
The terrible metal hacking seasons's as American as ski up off a plastic d-cup
You'd think Charlie Brown was Weathermen
How I zig-zag around these yellow backs for peanuts
In the baggy stomach lining attached to the bums in hiding sits the morals
Every outing would slide to refine his grinding
When the freakishly disfigured have been triggered to surround you
You will live inside the actual second they let the hounds loose

(Pluto-Pluto, bring back Pluto)
